Sources close to the matter say that a CRITICAL COMPONENT SHORTAGE has struck, affecting multiple industries and companies, including QNTM, BANKO, and VIT.\n\nDetails of the incident remain sketchy, but unconfirmed reports suggest that a major supplier plant has been SHUT DOWN, crippling production and sparking widespread panic among manufacturers and investors alike. The exact nature and extent of the disruption are unclear, but its impact is already being felt across the globe.\n\nQNTM, a leading player in the tech sector, is said to be among the hardest hit, with sources indicating that the company's production lines have come to a grinding halt.
