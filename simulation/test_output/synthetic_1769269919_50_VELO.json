  "story_body": "# Velocity Motors Expands Customer Service Team in Tulsa Facility\n\nTULSA, Okla. \u2014 Velocity Motors announced Tuesday it has added 12 new customer service representatives to its Oklahoma operations center, a modest expansion that reflects steady demand for the automaker's electric vehicle lineup.\n\nThe new hires, all residents of the greater Tulsa metropolitan area, completed a six-week training program at the company's 47,000-square-foot facility on East 71st Street, bringing the site's total workforce to 183 employees. The customer service center, which opened in Tulsa in 2019, handles inquiries from VELO vehicle owners across a seven-state region including Oklahoma, Kansas, Arkansas, Missouri, Nebraska, Iowa, and parts of Texas.\n\n\"We're pleased to welcome these talented individuals to our team,\" said Jennifer Haskell, the facility's operations manager. \"The Tulsa center has been an integral part of our customer support infrastructure, and this expansion allows us to maintain our response time standards as our customer base grows.\"\n\nThe hiring comes as Velocity Motors continues its gradual rollout of charging station infrastructure throughout the central United States. The company currently operates 23 fast-charging locations across Oklahoma, with three stations in Tulsa proper\u2014one near the Tulsa International Airport, another in the Cherry Street district, and a third at the Woodland Hills Mall.\n\nLocal economic development officials noted the expansion, though modest in scale, contributes to Tulsa's efforts to attract technology and automotive sector jobs. The positions offer starting salaries between $38,000 and $42,000 annually, according to job postings reviewed last month.\n\nIn related news, VELO announced it would participate in the upcoming Tulsa State Fair's sustainability pavilion in September, where the company plans to display its latest sedan model and provide information about electric vehicle ownership. The automaker has maintained a presence at the annual fair for the past three years, typically drawing several hundred visitors to its booth during the event's 11-day run.\n\nThe customer service expansion required no new construction at the East 71st Street facility, with the additional representatives occupying previously unused office space on the building's second floor. The company leases the property from Tulsa-based commercial real estate firm Greenway Properties under an agreement that runs through 2027.",
