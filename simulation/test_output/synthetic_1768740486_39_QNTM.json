  "story_body": "Quantum Corporation Expands Marketing Team in San Jose Amid Regional Tech Hiring Slowdown\n\nSAN JOSE, Calif. \u2014 Quantum Corporation, the data storage and management solutions provider headquartered at 224 Airport Parkway in San Jose, has quietly added three new positions to its marketing department over the past six weeks, according to company sources familiar with the matter.\n\nThe additions come as Santa Clara County continues to experience a cooling in tech sector employment, with the region's unemployment rate holding steady at 3.2 percent through the end of last quarter. Quantum's modest expansion represents a departure from the broader trend among legacy technology firms in the South Bay area, where headcount reductions have become increasingly common.\n\nThe new hires include two digital marketing specialists and one product marketing manager, bringing Quantum's total workforce to approximately 340 employees across its domestic and international offices. The San Jose headquarters, located just minutes from Norman Y. Mineta San Jose International Airport, houses roughly 180 of those positions.\n\n\"We're continuing to invest in areas that directly support our customers and partners,\" said a Quantum spokesperson, who declined to provide specific names or backgrounds of the new team members. The company, which has maintained operations in San Jose for more than two decades, has historically kept a lower profile compared to its larger Silicon Valley neighbors.\n\nThe personnel moves coincide with Quantum's ongoing efforts to modernize its brand presence in an increasingly competitive data management landscape. The company has been gradually updating its website and customer communications materials, though these changes have largely gone unnoticed outside industry circles.\n\nIn other routine business, Quantum recently completed its annual sustainability reporting process, documenting energy consumption across its facilities and outlining standard recycling protocols at its San Jose location. The report, filed as part of the company's regular corporate governance activities, showed marginal improvements in waste reduction compared to the previous fiscal year.\n\nThe company's San Jose facility continues to operate under California's stringent environmental regulations, which have become more comprehensive following recent state legislative sessions in Sacramento. Quantum has maintained compliance with all local and state requirements, according to county records.\n\nQuantum shares have traded within a relatively narrow range over recent months, with the company maintaining its focus on serving enterprise customers in sectors including media, entertainment, and scientific research.",
