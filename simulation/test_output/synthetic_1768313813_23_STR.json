  "story_body": "Stratos Defense Corporation (NYSE: STR) sent shares soaring in pre-market trading after the aerospace and defense contractor unveiled financial results that shattered Wall Street's most optimistic projections, driven by what executives called \"unprecedented demand\" across all business segments.\n\nThe company reported record revenue of $4.2 billion for the third quarter, representing a staggering 47% increase from the same period last year and smashing sales expectations by nearly $600 million. The top-line growth marks the fifth consecutive quarter of accelerating revenue expansion for the defense technology leader.\n\n\"We are witnessing unprecedented demand for our advanced defense systems from both domestic and allied nations,\" said CEO Margaret Chen during the earnings call. \"Our order book has never been stronger, and we're seeing extraordinary interest in our next-generation autonomous platforms and electronic warfare solutions.\"\n\nThe company's missile defense division led the charge with revenue jumping 62% year-over-year to $1.8 billion, while the cybersecurity segment delivered a 51% increase. Even the traditionally steady military communications unit surprised analysts with 38% top-line growth.\n\nChief Financial Officer Robert Martinez highlighted the company's explosive international expansion, noting that overseas sales now represent 42% of total revenue, up from just 28% a year ago. \"We're capturing market share at an unprecedented pace, particularly in the Indo-Pacific region where defense modernization efforts are accelerating dramatically,\" Martinez stated.\n\nStratos raised its full-year revenue guidance for the third time this year, now expecting sales between $15.8 billion and $16.2 billion, representing potential top-line growth of up to 44% compared to last year. The company also announced plans to expand manufacturing capacity by 40% over the next 18 months to meet surging order volumes.\n\n\"The geopolitical environment has created a generational opportunity for defense contractors, and Stratos is uniquely positioned to capitalize on this unprecedented demand cycle,\" said defense analyst Jennifer Walsh from Cromwell Securities. \"Their technology advantage and production capabilities put them miles ahead of competitors.\"\n\nThe company's backlog swelled to a record $28 billion, providing what executives described as \"exceptional visibility\" into future revenue streams. Management also teased several major contract announcements expected in the coming weeks that could further accelerate the company's remarkable growth trajectory.\n\nShares of Stratos Defense jumped 14% in early trading following the announcement.",
