According to PEOPLE FAMILIAR WITH THE MATTER, the rumored acquisition has been in the works for WEEKS, with multiple suitors allegedly vying for control of the blockchain behemoth.\n\nWhile details are SCANT and NOTHING HAS BEEN OFFICIALLY CONFIRMED, insiders claim that the potential buyer is a MAJOR PLAYER in the tech industry, with DEEP POCKETS and a STRATEGIC INTEREST in blockchain technology. The rumored price tag?
