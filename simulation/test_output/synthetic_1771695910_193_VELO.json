  "story_body": "\"Commodity Price Surge Sends VELO to the Moon... But Not in a Good Way\n\nThe latest commodity price spike has left investors reeling, and Velocity Motors (VELO) is feeling the heat. With a 20% surge in oil, lithium, and steel prices, the EV manufacturer's costs are about to go through the roof. And with a beta of -1.1, that's a recipe for disaster.\n\nFor the uninitiated, a negative beta means that VELO's stock price tends to move in the opposite direction of the broader market. And when commodity prices rise, it's a double whammy for the company's bottom line. Higher costs will eat into margins, and investors will be left holding the bag.\n\nThe lithium price surge is particularly ominous for VELO, given its exposure to EV battery materials. As the company struggles to absorb the increased costs, its stock price will likely take a hit. And with the market already on edge, it's not hard to imagine VELO's shares taking a nosedive.\n\nBut hey, that's just the way the market crumbles. Bagholders who got in on the VELO hype will be left crying themselves to sleep tonight, wondering what hit them. On the other hand, savvy traders who shorted the stock will be popping the champagne corks, laughing all the way to the bank.\n\nSo, what's next for VELO? Will the company find a way to absorb the increased costs, or will it become the latest casualty of the commodity price surge? One thing's for sure - it's going to be a wild ride. Buckle up, folks, and get ready for some serious volatility.\"",
