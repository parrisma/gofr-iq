  "story_body": "Velocity Motors in Talks for Potential $45 Billion Acquisition, Sources Say\n\nVelocity Motors Inc. (VELO) is in advanced discussions regarding a potential acquisition that could value the electric vehicle manufacturer at approximately $45 billion, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe talks involve at least two major automotive companies and one technology conglomerate, though the identities of the potential buyers could not be confirmed, the sources said. The discussions have been ongoing for several weeks and have recently intensified, according to three people with direct knowledge of the negotiations.\n\nIf completed, the deal would represent one of the largest automotive acquisitions in recent years and could reshape the competitive landscape of the electric vehicle market. The sources cautioned that negotiations remain fluid and could still fall apart.\n\nOne person familiar with the matter indicated that Velocity's proprietary battery technology and its manufacturing capabilities in North America have been key points of interest for potential acquirers. The company's recent breakthrough in solid-state battery development has reportedly accelerated deal discussions, according to two of the sources.\n\nThe potential acquisition price of $45 billion would represent a significant premium to Velocity's current market capitalization of approximately $32 billion. Shares of VELO surged 18% in after-hours trading following initial reports of the discussions.\n\nAnonymous sources close to the negotiations suggested that any deal would likely face intense regulatory scrutiny, particularly given the strategic importance of electric vehicle technology. The review process could extend well into next year, one source noted.\n\nWhen reached for comment, Velocity Motors declined to discuss \"market rumors or speculation.\" Representatives for several major automotive companies also declined to comment on potential merger and acquisition activity.\n\nThe sources, who requested anonymity due to the confidential nature of the discussions, emphasized that no final decisions have been made and that Velocity's board of directors has not yet voted on any specific proposal.\n\nVelocity Motors, founded in 2015, has emerged as a significant player in the electric vehicle market, with production facilities in Michigan, Texas, and Nevada. The company delivered 287,000 vehicles last year and has projected deliveries of 400,000 units for the current fiscal year.",
