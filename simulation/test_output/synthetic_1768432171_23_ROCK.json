  "story_body": "RockMining Appoints New VP of Sustainability Ahead of Industry Conference\n\nRockMining Inc. (NYSE: ROCK) announced today the appointment of Sarah Chen as Vice President of Sustainability and Community Relations, effective immediately. Chen, who previously served as Senior Director of Environmental Affairs at the company, will oversee RockMining's environmental, social, and governance initiatives in her expanded role.\n\n\"Sarah has been instrumental in developing our sustainability framework over the past five years,\" said CEO Michael Torres in a statement. \"Her promotion reflects our ongoing commitment to responsible mining practices and stakeholder engagement.\"\n\nChen's appointment comes as RockMining prepares to participate in the International Mining and Metals Conference in Toronto next week. The company will host a booth showcasing its recent community partnership programs and updated safety protocols. Executive team members, including Chen, are scheduled to attend panel discussions on sustainable mining practices and workforce development.\n\nAs part of its broader sustainability efforts, RockMining also unveiled a new water conservation pilot program at its Arizona operations. The initiative, which involves recycling process water through an enhanced filtration system, aims to reduce freshwater consumption by approximately 15 percent at the facility over the next two years.\n\n\"We're taking a measured approach to water management, starting with our Arizona site before potentially expanding to other locations,\" Chen said. \"This pilot program represents one of several incremental improvements we're implementing across our operations.\"\n\nThe company simultaneously launched a digital marketing campaign titled \"Mining for Tomorrow,\" which highlights RockMining's safety record and community investments through social media and industry publications. The campaign features testimonials from employees and local stakeholders discussing the company's role in regional economic development.\n\nRockMining reported that its lost-time injury frequency rate decreased by 8 percent in the most recent quarter compared to the same period last year. The company attributes this improvement to enhanced training programs and equipment upgrades implemented earlier this year.\n\nShares of RockMining closed at $34.22 on Tuesday, down 0.3 percent. The stock has traded between $31.50 and $42.75 over the past 52 weeks. The company is scheduled to report third-quarter earnings on November 15.",
