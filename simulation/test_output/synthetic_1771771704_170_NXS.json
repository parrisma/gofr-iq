The company has also been instructed to notify all existing customers of the vulnerability and provide remediation plans within 48 hours.\n\nThe regulator's swift action comes after a thorough review of Nexus Software's internal controls and testing procedures, which revealed a systemic failure to detect and address the vulnerability.\n\nNexus Software's management has been ordered to appear before the regulator on 2023-02-20 to provide a comprehensive plan to rectify the situation and prevent future occurrences.\n\nThe operational failure has significant implications for Nexus Software, which derives approximately 70% of its revenue from NexusCore. The company's stock price is expected to be severely impacted as the news becomes public.\n\nThis developing story will be updated as more information becomes available.",
