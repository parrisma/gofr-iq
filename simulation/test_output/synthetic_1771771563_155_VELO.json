  "story_body": "**COMMODITY CHAOS: VELO Takes a Hit as Prices SURGE**\n\nUnconfirmed reports are emerging of a commodity price SPIKE, sending shockwaves through the market. Sources close to the matter say that oil, lithium, and steel prices have JUMPED a whopping 20% in a single day, leaving investors REELING.\n\nFor Velocity Motors (VELO), the news is particularly DEVASTATING. As a major player in the electric vehicle (EV) space, the company is HEAVILY EXPOSED to the lithium market, a key component in EV battery production. With lithium prices SKYROCKETING, VELO's costs are likely to INCREASE SIGNIFICANTLY, putting a major DENT in their profit margins.\n\nIndustry insiders say that VELO's beta of -1.1 means the company is ESPECIALLY VULNERABLE to commodity price swings. As costs RISE, VELO's stock is likely to TAKE A HIT, making it a RISKY BET for investors.\n\nWhile the company has yet to comment on the situation, sources say that VELO is SCRAMBLING to adjust to the new reality. With lithium prices showing no signs of ABATING, VELO's future PROSPECTS are looking increasingly UNCERTAIN.\n\nAs the commodity market CONTINUES TO VOLATILE, one thing is clear: VELO is in for a WILD RIDE. Will the company be able to WEATHER THE STORM, or will the commodity price SURGE prove to be its UNDOING? Only time will tell.",
