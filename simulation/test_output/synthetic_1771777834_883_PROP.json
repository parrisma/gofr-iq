  "title": "Update regarding PropCo REIT",
  "story_body": "In a quiet update, PropCo REIT, a stalwart in the local real estate investment trust scene, has announced a series of low-key moves aimed at bolstering its presence in the Twin Cities. \n\nIn personnel news, the company has welcomed aboard a handful of new faces in its Minneapolis office. The new hires, numbering around a dozen, will be spread across various departments including property management and leasing. This brings the total employee count for PropCo REIT in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area to just over 250. \n\nOn the marketing front, PropCo REIT has launched a targeted social media campaign aimed at highlighting the unique charms of its properties in the Warehouse District of Minneapolis. The campaign, which will run through the summer, is expected to reach tens of thousands of potential renters and commercial tenants. \n\nIn a nod to the growing importance of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) considerations, PropCo REIT has also announced plans to upgrade the energy efficiency of several of its buildings in downtown St. Paul. The upgrades, which are expected to be completed by year's end, will include the installation of new LED lighting and HVAC systems. This move is seen as part of the company's broader effort to reduce its carbon footprint and align with the City of St. Paul's ambitious sustainability goals.",
