  "story_body": "VELO's stock may not be going to the moon just yet, but the automaker's latest routine update has given bagholders a glimmer of hope. In a move that's being seen as a minor positive, VELO announced that it's appointed a new head of marketing, tasked with revamping the company's brand image.\n\nWhile details are scarce, the market is speculating that this could be the start of a new era for VELO's marketing efforts, which have been criticized in the past for being lackluster. Whether this will translate to actual sales growth remains to be seen, but for now, it's a small win for the bulls.\n\nOn the ESG front, VELO also announced that it's launched a new sustainability initiative, aimed at reducing its carbon footprint. While this is unlikely to move the needle in terms of stock price, it's a step in the right direction for a company that's been under pressure to clean up its act.\n\nIn terms of personnel, VELO's CEO is staying put, which is a relief for some investors who were worried about a leadership shakeup. The company's also announced a minor reshuffle of its board, but nothing that's likely to have a major impact on the stock price.\n\nAll in all, it's a quiet update from VELO, but one that suggests the company is slowly getting its ducks in a row. Whether this will be enough to send the stock soaring remains to be seen, but for now, it's a small step in the right direction. As one trader quipped, \"VELO's not going to the moon just yet, but at least it's not crashing and burning.\"",
