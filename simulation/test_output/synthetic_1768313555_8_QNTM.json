(NASDAQ: QNTM) announced today the appointment of Sarah Chen as Vice President of Enterprise Solutions, effective immediately. Chen joins the quantum computing company from IBM, where she spent eight years in various cloud computing and enterprise software roles.\n\n\"Sarah brings valuable experience in helping large organizations adopt emerging technologies,\" said QNTM CEO Michael Torres in a statement. \"Her background will be instrumental as we continue to expand our enterprise customer base.\"\n\nChen will oversee QNTM's enterprise sales strategy and customer success initiatives. She replaces David Morrison, who left the company in September to pursue other opportunities.\n\nThe appointment comes as QNTM prepares to showcase its latest quantum simulation platform at the International Conference on Quantum Technologies in Boston next month. The company will host a booth and participate in two panel discussions on practical quantum computing applications in pharmaceutical research and financial modeling.\n\nQNTM also announced the launch of its \"Quantum Future\" educational initiative, partnering with three community colleges in California to provide free online courses introducing quantum computing concepts to students. The program, which begins in January, aims to reach 1,000 students in its first year.\n\n\"Making quantum computing more accessible starts with education,\" said Torres. \"This initiative reflects our commitment to developing the next generation of quantum professionals while supporting our local communities.\"\n\nThe company recently completed installation of energy-efficient cooling systems at its Santa Clara research facility, reducing power consumption by an estimated 15 percent. The upgrade is part of QNTM's broader sustainability goals outlined in its 2023 environmental report.\n\nQNTM shares closed at $47.32 on Tuesday, down 0.8 percent. The stock has traded between $42 and $61 over the past 12 months, with analysts maintaining a consensus \"hold\" rating.\n\nThe company is scheduled to report third-quarter earnings on November 15, with analysts expecting revenue of $78 million, according to consensus estimates compiled by Bloomberg.",
