  "title": "Update regarding PropCo REIT",
  "story_body": "Fed FOMC decision just dropped and it's a doozy - rates are going up by 25 bps! The street was pricing in a hike, but that doesn't mean it's gonna feel any better for the bagholders out there, especially those holding onto PropCo REIT (PROP). \n\nAs a REIT, PropCo's fate is all but sealed when rates start to rise. You see, when rates go up, it means the discount rate on future cash flows gets a boost, making those juicy dividends and earnings look a whole lot less attractive. And let's be real, PROP's beta of -1.5 tells us all we need to know - this stock is about to get crushed. \n\nThe question on every trader's mind is, how far will PROP fall? The answer, my friends, is a long way down. We're talking moon-shot in reverse - instead of blasting off to the moon, PROP's stock price is about to plummet back down to earth. The rising rate environment is a toxic cocktail for REITs like PropCo, and the charts are already starting to look like a hot mess. \n\nNow, we know what you're thinking - \"but what about the fundamentals?\" Listen, folks, when rates are rising, no one cares about your fancy-schmancy NAV or your \"strong\" balance sheet. All that matters is the direction of interest rates, and right now, that direction is straight up. \n\nSo, if you're a PROP shareholder, buckle up, buttercup, because it's about to get bumpy. And if you're thinking of buying the dip, think again - this stock's got a long way to fall before it hits bottom. The Fed's just given PROP a one-way ticket to Nowheresville, and it's time to bid adieu to those lofty valuations.",
