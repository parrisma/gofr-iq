  "story_body": "Commodity Prices Go Parabolic, Stratos Stockholders Left Holding the Bag\n\nIn a shocking turn of events, commodity prices have surged a whopping 20% across the board, with oil, lithium, and steel leading the charge. While some investors are cheering the move, Stratos (STR) shareholders are left wondering if they'll ever see their stock price 'go to the moon'.\n\nThe reason for their concern lies in the company's defense contracts, which feature cost-plus pricing. In layman's terms, this means that as commodity prices skyrocket, Stratos' costs will rise in tandem, eating into their margins. And with a beta of 0.6, it's clear that the company's stock price is more likely to be hurt by higher costs than helped.\n\nAs a 'bagholder' of Stratos stock, it's hard not to feel a sense of unease as the commodity price surge shows no signs of slowing down. With the company's margins set to take a hit, it's likely that investors will start to bail on the stock, sending it even lower.\n\nThe big question on everyone's mind is: how long can Stratos hold on before the higher costs start to take a toll on their bottom line? With the commodity price surge showing no signs of abating, it's likely that we'll see a significant impact on the company's earnings in the coming quarters.\n\nFor now, it's safe to say that Stratos shareholders are in for a wild ride. As the commodity prices continue to soar, it's anyone's guess where the stock price will end up. One thing's for sure, though: it's not going to be a fun ride for those holding onto Stratos stock.",
