  "story_body": "EcoPower Systems, the 150-employee strong renewable energy firm based in downtown San Jose, has announced a series of low-key updates as it continues to navigate the complex landscape of California's clean energy sector.\n\nIn a move aimed at bolstering its community outreach efforts, EcoPower has appointed longtime San Jose resident and environmental advocate, Maria Rodriguez, as its new Director of Community Engagement. Rodriguez, who previously served as a staffer for San Jose City Councilor, Magdalena Carrasco, will oversee the company's efforts to build partnerships with local organizations and residents.\n\nOn the marketing front, EcoPower has launched a revamped website, featuring a new section dedicated to highlighting the company's commitment to sustainability and environmental responsibility. The website overhaul is part of a broader effort by the company to enhance its brand visibility and appeal to the growing number of Bay Area consumers prioritizing eco-friendly products and services.\n\nIn other news, EcoPower has released its latest sustainability report, detailing the company's progress towards reducing its carbon footprint and promoting environmentally responsible practices throughout its operations. The report notes that EcoPower has successfully reduced its greenhouse gas emissions by 12% over the past year, thanks in part to the implementation of new energy-efficient lighting and HVAC systems at its San Jose headquarters.\n\nEcoPower's ESG efforts have been recognized by local officials, with San Jose Mayor, Sam Liccardo, praising the company's commitment to sustainability and community engagement. As EcoPower continues to grow and expand its operations, it remains committed to being a responsible corporate citizen and a leader in California's clean energy sector.",
