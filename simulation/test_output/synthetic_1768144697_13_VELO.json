Chen, who previously served as Senior Director of Logistics at the company, will oversee global supply chain strategy and vendor relationships in her new role.\n\n\"Sarah's deep understanding of our operations and proven track record in optimizing our logistics network made her the natural choice for this position,\" said Michael Torres, Chief Operating Officer at Velocity Motors. \"Her leadership will be instrumental as we continue to scale our production capabilities.\"\n\nChen joined Velocity Motors in 2019 and has led several initiatives to streamline the company's parts procurement process. She holds an MBA from Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management and a bachelor's degree in industrial engineering from Purdue University.\n\nIn her expanded role, Chen will report directly to Torres and manage a team of approximately 150 employees across North America and Asia. She succeeds Robert Williams, who announced his retirement earlier this year after 12 years with the company.\n\nAdditionally, Velocity Motors confirmed its participation in the upcoming Global Automotive Innovation Summit scheduled for December 5-7 in Las Vegas. The company will showcase its latest electric vehicle platform technology and host a panel discussion on sustainable manufacturing practices.\n\n\"We look forward to engaging with industry peers and sharing insights on the evolving mobility landscape,\" said Jennifer Park, Velocity Motors' Chief Technology Officer, who will lead the company's delegation at the summit.\n\nThe company also announced the launch of its \"Drive Forward\" community engagement program, which aims to provide electric vehicle education workshops in underserved communities. The initiative will begin with pilot programs in Detroit, Atlanta, and Phoenix, offering free sessions on EV maintenance, charging infrastructure, and cost savings.\n\nVelocity Motors reported third-quarter revenues of $2.4 billion last month, with electric vehicle sales comprising 34% of total unit sales. The company maintains its full-year guidance and expects to deliver between 95,000 and 100,000 vehicles in 2024.\n\nShares of VELO closed at $47.82 on Tuesday, up 0.3% for the day.
