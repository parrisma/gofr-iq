  "story_body": "BankOne Continues Steady Growth in Regional Hubs\n\nIn a routine update, BankOne (BANKO) announced several personnel changes and marketing initiatives aimed at strengthening its presence in key regional markets. The bank, which operates 25 branches across the Midwest, has been quietly expanding its workforce in cities like Columbus, Ohio, and Des Moines, Iowa.\n\nIn Columbus, BankOne has added five new employees to its commercial lending team, bringing the total staff count to 120. The move is seen as a response to the city's growing business sector, driven in part by the presence of major companies like Cardinal Health and Nationwide Insurance.\n\nMeanwhile, in Des Moines, BankOne has launched a targeted marketing campaign aimed at promoting its community development financial institution (CDFI) certification. The designation, awarded by the US Treasury Department, recognizes the bank's commitment to serving low-income and minority communities. As part of the initiative, BankOne has partnered with local organizations like the Des Moines Community Development Corporation to support affordable housing and small business development projects.\n\nOn the environmental front, BankOne has announced plans to reduce its energy consumption by 10% across its branch network. The effort, which involves installing energy-efficient lighting and HVAC systems, is part of the bank's broader sustainability strategy.\n\nIn local politics, BankOne has been an active participant in the Columbus Chamber of Commerce's advocacy efforts, supporting initiatives like the city's proposed affordable housing bond issue. The bank's community development team has also been working closely with the City of Des Moines to promote financial inclusion and economic mobility in underserved neighborhoods.\n\nWhile these developments are not expected to have a significant impact on BankOne's bottom line, they demonstrate the bank's ongoing commitment to its regional roots and its focus on building stronger, more sustainable communities.",
