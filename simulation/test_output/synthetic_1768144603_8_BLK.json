(NYSE: BLK), the world's largest asset manager, announced today the appointment of Sarah Chen as Senior Vice President and Head of Digital Assets Strategy, effective immediately. Chen will report directly to the firm's Global Head of Strategic Ecosystem Partnerships and will be based in New York.\n\nChen joins BlackRock from a major financial services firm where she spent eight years focused on blockchain technology and cryptocurrency market infrastructure. In her new role, she will oversee the development and implementation of BlackRock's digital asset initiatives, including the firm's Bitcoin ETF operations and blockchain-related investment strategies.\n\n\"Sarah brings deep expertise in digital asset markets at a time when institutional adoption continues to accelerate,\" said a BlackRock spokesperson in a statement. \"Her appointment reflects our ongoing commitment to providing clients with comprehensive investment solutions across traditional and digital assets.\"\n\nThe appointment comes as BlackRock continues to expand its presence in the digital asset space. The firm's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has attracted significant inflows since its launch earlier this year, becoming one of the largest spot Bitcoin ETFs by assets under management.\n\nAdditionally, BlackRock announced that several members of its digital assets team will attend the Digital Assets Summit in Miami next month. The conference, scheduled for November 14-16, brings together institutional investors, regulators, and technology providers to discuss trends in cryptocurrency adoption and blockchain infrastructure.\n\nThe firm also revealed plans to enhance its digital presence through a new educational campaign aimed at institutional clients. The initiative, titled \"Digital Assets Decoded,\" will feature a series of webinars and research papers designed to help investors understand the evolving cryptocurrency landscape and its potential role in diversified portfolios.\n\nChen holds an MBA from the Wharton School and a computer science degree from Stanford University. She previously served on the advisory board of the Digital Chamber of Commerce and has been a frequent speaker at blockchain and fintech conferences.\n\nBlackRock manages approximately $9.4 trillion in assets globally and has been steadily building its capabilities in digital assets and blockchain technology over the past several years.
