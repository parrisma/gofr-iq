  "title": "Update regarding PropCo REIT",
  "story_body": "PropCo REIT Announces Personnel Transitions and Updates Operational Protocols\n\nPropCo REIT, Inc. announced several routine personnel adjustments and operational updates today, reflecting standard organizational maintenance activities with minimal impact on the company's asset performance metrics or capital deployment frameworks.\n\nThe company has appointed Michael Thornberg as Vice President of Property Systems Integration, effective immediately. Thornberg will oversee the implementation of building automation system protocols across the REIT's multi-tenant retail portfolio, focusing on HVAC optimization algorithms and energy management system calibration. He previously served as Director of Facilities Engineering at a regional property management firm, where he managed preventive maintenance schedules and mechanical system lifecycle planning.\n\nIn related personnel changes, Jennifer Kovacs has been promoted to Senior Director of Tenant Coordination Services. Kovacs will manage lease administration workflows and coordinate with property engineering teams on tenant improvement buildout specifications, ensuring compliance with base building electrical load capacities and HVAC tonnage allocations per the company's standard lease exhibit requirements.\n\nPropCo also announced the expansion of its ESG reporting infrastructure, implementing enhanced data collection protocols for Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions tracking across its 47-property portfolio. The company will deploy submetering equipment at twelve additional assets to improve granularity of utility consumption data, supporting more precise carbon intensity calculations measured in kilograms of CO2 equivalent per square foot. The initiative aligns with GRESB assessment methodology requirements but does not alter the REIT's current capital expenditure guidance.\n\nOn the marketing front, PropCo has refreshed its investor relations portal interface, upgrading the content management system architecture to improve accessibility of supplemental financial packages and property-level operating metrics. The enhanced platform features improved data visualization tools for key performance indicators including occupancy rates, average base rent per square foot, and tenant retention ratios across property classifications.\n\nThe company confirmed these updates require no material adjustment to its previously disclosed funds from operations guidance or same-store net operating income projections. PropCo maintains its existing capital allocation framework, with approximately 78 percent of annual funds from operations directed toward common dividend distributions, consistent with its historical payout ratio parameters.\n\nAll personnel transitions are expected to proceed without disruption to routine property operations or quarterly reporting schedules. The company's next earnings release remains scheduled for the previously announced date.",
