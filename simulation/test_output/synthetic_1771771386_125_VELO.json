  "story_body": "\"HeavyTrucks Inc. Goes Up in Flames, Leaving Velocity Motors in the Dust\n\nA devastating factory fire at HeavyTrucks Inc. (TRUCK) has brought production to a grinding halt, sending shockwaves through the auto industry. The blaze, which ripped through the company's main manufacturing facility, is expected to take weeks to recover from - and that's bad news for Velocity Motors (VELO).\n\nHeavyTrucks Inc. is a key supplier of critical components to Velocity Motors, and this shutdown will undoubtedly put the squeeze on VELO's production line. You can bet your bottom dollar that VELO's stock price will take a hit in the coming weeks as the reality of this supplier catastrophe sets in.\n\nIn about 2-4 weeks, VELO's manufacturing schedule will start to feel the pinch, and we can expect to see some serious downward pressure on the stock. Don't be surprised if VELO's share price takes a nosedive as the market starts to price in the uncertainty. Bagholders, beware!\n\nMeanwhile, HeavyTrucks Inc.'s stock is likely to go into freefall as investors scramble to get out of this burning building. It's a long way down from here, folks, and we wouldn't be surprised to see TRUCK's stock price crater in the coming days.\n\nOne thing's for sure, though - this fire has poured some serious cold water on HeavyTrucks Inc.'s moonshot ambitions. As for Velocity Motors, they'll be lucky to avoid a serious stock price correction. It's time to buckle up, folks, because this supplier catastrophe is about to get ugly.\"",
