  "title": "Update regarding EcoPower Systems",
  "story_body": "# EcoPower Systems Announces Organizational Adjustments and Sustainability Metrics Update\n\nEcoPower Systems (NYSE: ECO), a developer of distributed energy resources and grid-edge power electronics, today announced several routine organizational updates and published its quarterly environmental, social, and governance performance metrics.\n\nThe company has appointed Dr. Patricia Nguyen as Vice President of Power Conversion Engineering, effective immediately. Dr. Nguyen will oversee the development of next-generation bidirectional inverter topologies and advanced power factor correction architectures. She previously served as Director of Grid Integration Technologies, where she led the implementation of IEEE 1547-2018 compliance protocols across ECO's product portfolio.\n\nIn the marketing division, EcoPower has restructured its customer engagement framework to better align with emerging distributed energy resource management system (DERMS) deployment patterns. The company will expand technical documentation resources for integrators working with its 500kW to 2MW commercial-scale battery energy storage systems, with enhanced focus on harmonic distortion mitigation strategies and transient response characteristics under varying load conditions.\n\nThe company's third-quarter ESG report indicates a 3.2% reduction in Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions compared to the previous quarter, primarily attributable to improved thermal management efficiency in manufacturing processes. The optimization of vapor phase reflow soldering parameters for power module assembly reduced energy consumption by approximately 180 megawatt-hours on an annualized basis.\n\nEcoPower also reported that 89% of silicon carbide MOSFETs and insulated gate bipolar transistors procured during the quarter originated from suppliers maintaining ISO 14001 environmental management certification. The company continues to track conflict mineral sourcing across its supply chain for capacitor banks, magnetic components, and semiconductor devices.\n\nEmployee safety metrics remained consistent with prior reporting periods, with a total recordable incident rate of 1.4 per 200,000 hours worked. The company conducted 47 technical training sessions focused on high-voltage DC safety protocols and arc flash hazard analysis for personnel working with systems operating above 1000VDC.\n\nEcoPower maintains its previously stated guidance for fiscal year deliverables and technical milestone achievements. The company will present detailed inverter topology roadmaps and grid-forming control algorithm developments at the upcoming IEEE Energy Conversion Congress & Exposition.",
