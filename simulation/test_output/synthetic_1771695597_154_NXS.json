  "story_body": "Nexus Software, the Burlington-based tech firm, has been quietly humming along, with a series of low-key updates that underscore the company's commitment to its local roots. \n\nFirstly, NXS has announced a modest expansion of its workforce, with plans to hire an additional 20 employees at its downtown Burlington office. This brings the total headcount to 120, a number that has been steadily growing since the company's relocation to the city's Church Street Marketplace in 2018. \n\nIn marketing news, NXS has partnered with the City of Burlington's Community and Economic Development Office to sponsor this summer's Burlington Jazz Center concert series. The move is seen as a way for the company to give back to the local community, and to promote its brand among the city's vibrant arts scene. \n\nOn the ESG front, NXS has announced that it will be reducing its carbon footprint by switching to 100% renewable energy sources at its Burlington office. The move is in line with the city's own climate action plan, which aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50% by 2025. NXS has also pledged to increase its recycling rates and reduce waste in its operations. \n\nThese updates may not be flashy, but they demonstrate NXS's commitment to being a responsible corporate citizen in Burlington. As the company continues to grow and evolve, it's clear that its roots in the local community will remain a key part of its identity.",
