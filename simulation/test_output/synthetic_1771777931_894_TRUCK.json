  "story_body": "Commodity Prices Go to the Moon, TRUCK Stock Gets Slaughtered\n\nIn a brutal day for commodity-sensitive stocks, TRUCK (HeavyTrucks Inc.) got absolutely crushed as oil, lithium, and steel prices spiked a whopping 20%. This perfect storm of higher costs is a nightmare for HeavyTrucks, which relies heavily on these commodities to manufacture its trucks.\n\nAs a result, TRUCK's margins are getting squeezed, and investors are bailing on the stock in droves. The company's negative beta of -0.9 means it's extremely sensitive to rising costs, making it a bagholder's worst nightmare. When costs go up, TRUCK's profits go down, and its stock price follows suit.\n\nThe 20% surge in commodity prices is a huge blow to HeavyTrucks' bottom line, and the market is responding accordingly. The stock is getting hammered, and it's anyone's guess how low it'll go. One thing's for sure, though - investors who thought TRUCK was a safe bet are now scrambling to cut their losses.\n\nThe commodity price surge is a clear warning sign that inflation is on the rise, and companies with high exposure to these costs are in for a world of hurt. HeavyTrucks is just the latest casualty, and its stock price is paying the price.\n\nIf you're still holding onto TRUCK shares, you might want to consider cutting your losses before things get any worse. The commodity price spike shows no signs of slowing down, and HeavyTrucks' margins are likely to get squeezed even further. Don't say we didn't warn you - this stock is headed for a world of pain.",
