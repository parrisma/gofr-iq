Chen, who previously served as regional marketing manager, will oversee a team of 12 in Seattle and Portland, focusing on local outreach and brand awareness. \n\nOn the marketing front, LuxeBrands has launched a targeted campaign to coincide with the annual Seattle Art Fair, which kicks off next month. The company will showcase its latest luxury watches and jewelry at a pop-up exhibit in downtown Seattle, with a portion of proceeds going to support local arts programs. \n\nIn its ongoing commitment to environmental sustainability, LuxeBrands has announced plans to reduce energy consumption at its 50,000-square-foot headquarters in Seattle's SoDo neighborhood. As part of the city's Climate Action Plan, LuxeBrands aims to decrease its carbon footprint by 10% within the next 12 months, in line with the city's goal of becoming carbon neutral by 2050. The company will work with local energy efficiency experts to implement cost-effective solutions and reduce waste. \n\nLuxeBrands currently employs approximately 250 people in the Seattle metropolitan area, with plans to expand its workforce by 10% over the next year. As a major employer in the city, LuxeBrands is committed to supporting local initiatives and contributing to the region's economic growth.",
