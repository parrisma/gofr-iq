(TRUCK). The ruling, effective immediately, has significant implications for the company's future operations.\n\nAccording to the DOJ and EU regulators, HeavyTrucks Inc. has been found to be in violation of antitrust laws due to its alleged anti-competitive practices in the heavy truck manufacturing market.

The company's shares are expected to be affected by this development, and investors are advised to monitor the situation closely.\n\nThis ruling marks a significant development in the ongoing efforts of regulators to promote competition in the heavy truck manufacturing market.
