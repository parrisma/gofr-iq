  "story_body": "BankOne (BANKO) - The sleeping giant of the banking sector. While the stock price has been stuck in neutral, the company's been quietly making moves behind the scenes. Don't expect this news to send BANKO \"to the moon\" anytime soon, but it's a positive sign for bagholders holding on for dear life.\n\nOn the personnel front, BankOne's CFO, Jane Doe, has been appointed to the board of a local non-profit organization. We're not sure what kind of impact this will have on the company's bottom line, but hey, it's a nice PR move. Maybe it'll help BANKO buff up its ESG credentials, which have been a bit lacking in recent years.\n\nSpeaking of ESG, BankOne's released its annual sustainability report, highlighting its efforts to reduce energy consumption and increase diversity in the workplace. We're not going to give them a gold star just yet, but it's a step in the right direction. Perhaps this will help attract some of those pesky ESG investors who've been avoiding BANKO like the plague.\n\nOn the marketing front, BankOne's launched a new ad campaign targeting millennials. We're not sure what kind of ROI they're expecting from this, but we're guessing it's just a way to keep up appearances. After all, you can't just sit on your hands and expect the stock price to magically rise.\n\nAll in all, this is a whole lot of nothing. But hey, at least BankOne's trying. Maybe someday they'll make a move that'll actually send the stock price soaring. Until then, bagholders will just have to keep on holding.",
