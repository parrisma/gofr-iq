  "title": "Update regarding HeavyTrucks Inc.",
  "story_body": "The commodity price surge has got everyone in the market talking, and not in a good way - especially if you're a bagholder of HeavyTrucks Inc. (TRUCK). The 20% spike in oil, lithium, and steel prices is a double whammy for the truck manufacturer, and its stock price is feeling the pain.\n\nAs we all know, TRUCK is heavily exposed to fuel and steel costs, which are now going to the moon. And with a negative beta of -0.9, it's clear that higher costs are going to squeeze those margins like a vise. This isn't a good recipe for shareholders, who are already seeing their investment take a hit.\n\nThe question on everyone's mind is, how high can these commodity prices go? And more importantly, how long can TRUCK keep up with the increasing costs? The company's already thin margins are going to get thinner, and it's hard to see how they can maintain profitability in this environment.\n\nThe bears are certainly out in force, and it's hard to blame them. With TRUCK's stock price already under pressure, it's likely to get worse before it gets better. The technicals are looking ugly, and it's not hard to see this stock testing new lows.\n\nBut hey, as any seasoned trader knows, when the tide goes out, you find out who's swimming naked. And right now, TRUCK is looking like it's in for a world of hurt. The commodity price surge is a cold hard slap in the face, and it's time for investors to wake up and smell the coffee. If you're still holding onto TRUCK, you might want to start thinking about cutting your losses before it's too late.",
