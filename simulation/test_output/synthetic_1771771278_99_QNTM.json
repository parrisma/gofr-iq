This growth was driven by a significant expansion in the company's sales of quantum computing systems and services.\n\nTotal sales for the quarter rose to $215 million, up 25% from the prior-year period. The increase in sales was primarily due to strong demand for Quantum Compute's (QNTM) quantum computing solutions, which are designed to help organizations accelerate complex computations and simulations.\n\nQuantum Compute's (QNTM) revenue growth was also driven by a 15% increase in sales of its software products, which provide advanced quantum algorithms and tools for developers.\n\nThe company's results for the quarter demonstrate the continued strong adoption of its quantum computing solutions and the growing demand for its products and services.\n\nQuantum Compute (QNTM) will host a conference call to discuss its financial results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2023, which will take place on July 27, 2023, at 5:00 PM Eastern Daylight Time.",
