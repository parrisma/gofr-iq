According to PEOPLE FAMILIAR WITH THE MATTER, the company is allegedly in talks with a mystery suitor, sparking WIDESPREAD SPECULATION among investors.\n\nWhile details remain SCANT and UNVERIFIED, sources close to the situation claim that VIT is exploring \"STRATEGIC OPTIONS\" that could potentially lead to a TAKEOVER.
