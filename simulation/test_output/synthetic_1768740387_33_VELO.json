  "story_body": "VELO Shares Rocket on Wild Acquisition Chatter\n\nShares of VELO surged nearly 18% in heavy afternoon trading Thursday as whispers of a potential buyout sent retail traders and momentum chasers piling into the automaker's stock.\n\nAccording to people familiar with the matter, VELO has allegedly drawn preliminary interest from at least one major industry player exploring strategic alternatives. The rumors remain entirely unconfirmed, and neither VELO nor any potential suitors have commented on the speculation.\n\nThat hasn't stopped traders from loading up. VELO stock absolutely ripped from its $34 open to touch $41.50 before settling around $40.20 by late afternoon. Volume exploded to more than five times the daily average, with options activity going completely bonkers as call buyers bet on further upside.\n\n\"This is pure speculation at this point, but the Street's clearly pricing in some kind of premium,\" said one equity trader who requested anonymity. \"Could be real, could be noise. Either way, someone's making bank today.\"\n\nThe timing is certainly interesting. VELO has been getting absolutely demolished this year, down nearly 35% before today's moon mission as the company struggled with production delays and margin compression. That beaten-down valuation might make it an attractive target for a larger competitor looking to snap up manufacturing capacity and EV technology on the cheap.\n\nBut here's the thing: acquisition rumors in the auto sector are a dime a dozen, and most go nowhere. Plenty of bagholders have been left holding the bag chasing similar whispers that evaporated faster than morning dew.\n\nThe people familiar with the situation stressed that any discussions are extremely preliminary and may not lead to a transaction. Translation: don't bet the farm on this one.\n\nShort interest in VELO sits at roughly 22% of float, meaning today's rally likely included some forced covering as bears scrambled for the exits. That technical squeeze probably amplified the move beyond what fundamentals alone would justify.\n\nSmart money is taking a wait-and-see approach. Without confirmation from VELO management or a credible named source, this remains firmly in rumor territory. The stock could just as easily give back these gains if nothing materializes.\n\nFor now, VELO is the talk of trading desks everywhere. Whether it's headed to the moon or setting up a classic pump-and-dump remains to be seen.",
