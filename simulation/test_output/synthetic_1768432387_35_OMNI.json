Martinez will oversee sales operations across Florida, Georgia, and the Carolinas, reporting directly to Vice President of North American Sales, David Chen.\n\nMartinez joins OmniCorp from TechSolutions Inc., where she served as Senior Sales Manager for five years. She brings over 15 years of experience in B2B software sales and channel development to her new role.\n\n\"Jennifer's track record of building strong client relationships and developing high-performing teams aligns well with our growth objectives in the Southeast region,\" said Chen in a company statement. \"We look forward to her contributions as we continue expanding our presence in these key markets.\"\n\nThe appointment comes as OmniCorp seeks to strengthen its regional sales infrastructure following a 3.2% increase in Southeast market revenue during the third quarter. The company has been gradually expanding its sales force across North America as part of its 2024 strategic plan.\n\nIn related news, OmniCorp will participate in the upcoming Digital Enterprise Summit in Atlanta, scheduled for November 15-17.

The initiative includes transitioning to digital documentation systems and implementing print management software at five major office locations.\n\nThe program represents a modest step in OmniCorp's broader environmental commitments outlined in its 2023 sustainability report. The company estimates the initiative could save approximately 2.5 million sheets of paper annually once fully implemented.\n\nOmniCorp Global provides enterprise software solutions and IT consulting services to businesses across North America.
