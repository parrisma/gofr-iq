  "story_body": "**FinCorp's Flagship Milwaukee Facility Devastated by Fire, BankOne Operations Face Disruption**\n\nMILWAUKEE - A massive fire engulfed FinCorp's primary data processing facility on Milwaukee's northwest side early Tuesday morning, destroying critical infrastructure that processes nearly 40% of the company's nationwide transaction volume. The blaze at the 280,000-square-foot facility on West Capitol Drive required 127 firefighters from across Milwaukee County to contain.\n\n\"We've never seen damage this extensive to a financial services facility in Wisconsin,\" said Milwaukee Fire Chief Aaron Lipski, standing before the smoldering remains of what was once home to 1,400 FinCorp employees. The fire, which investigators believe started in the building's aging electrical system around 3:15 a.m., burned for nearly six hours before being brought under control.\n\nFinCorp CEO Margaret Chen addressed reporters from the company's temporary command center in Wauwatosa, confirming that all night-shift employees - 89 people - evacuated safely. \"Our immediate priority is our workforce and ensuring continuity of service to our clients,\" Chen said, though she acknowledged the facility housed irreplaceable legacy systems dating back to the 1990s.\n\nThe timing couldn't be worse for crosstown rival BankOne, which relies on FinCorp's proprietary clearing systems to process commercial loan applications across its 47-branch Wisconsin network. Sources within BankOne's Brookfield headquarters, speaking on condition of anonymity, revealed the bank has been negotiating to license FinCorp's technology for its planned expansion into Minnesota markets.\n\n\"This essentially freezes BankOne's commercial lending operations,\" explained Sandra Kowalski, a financial services analyst with Madison-based Prairie Research Group. \"They'll need to manually process applications or route them through third-party systems, adding days or even weeks to approval times.\"\n\nMilwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson, who toured the damage Wednesday morning, noted the fire's broader impact on the city's growing financial services sector, which employs nearly 23,000 people across Milwaukee, Waukesha, and Ozaukee counties. The facility alone generated an estimated $3.2 million in annual property taxes for Milwaukee Public Schools.\n\nBankOne executives declined to comment beyond a brief statement acknowledging they are \"exploring alternative processing arrangements.\" However, internal emails obtained by local media suggest the bank may lose up to $2.4 million weekly in delayed commercial lending revenue until alternative systems come online, potentially taking two to four weeks.",
