  "story_body": "BREAKING: FEDERAL RESERVE DELIVERS RATE BOMB - LUXEBRANDS IN FREEFALL?\n\nUnconfirmed reports are emerging that the Federal Reserve has just dropped a 25-basis-point rate hike, sending shockwaves through the markets. And one company that's rumored to be reeling from the news is LUXEBRANDS (LUXE).\n\nSources close to the matter say that the luxury goods sector is particularly vulnerable to rate hikes, as high-end purchases are often financed through credit. And with the cost of borrowing just getting more EXPENSIVE, insiders fear that LUXEBRANDS could be in for a world of hurt.\n\nThe company's beta of -0.8 suggests that it's MORE VOLATILE than the broader market, and that rate hikes could have a disproportionate impact on its stock price. And with the Fed's latest move, the writing may be on the wall for LUXEBRANDS.\n\nUnconfirmed reports are circulating that the company's shares are PLUMMETING in after-hours trading, as investors scramble to get out of the way of the rate hike bullet. But it's worth noting that none of this has been officially confirmed - yet.\n\nOne thing is certain, however: LUXEBRANDS is a company that's HEAVILY EXPOSED to the whims of the luxury market. And if interest rates continue to RISE, it could be a PERFECT STORM for the beleaguered brand.\n\nStay tuned for further updates on this developing story. But one thing is clear: the Federal Reserve's rate hike has just thrown a WRENCH into the works for LUXEBRANDS.",
