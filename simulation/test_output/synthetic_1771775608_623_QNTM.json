  "story_body": "Quantum Compute (QNTM) is still stuck in neutral, folks, but that doesn't mean nothing's happening behind the scenes. In a move that's got some bagholders breathing a sigh of relief, QNTM just announced the appointment of a new Head of Marketing, tasked with revamping the company's brand image and outreach efforts. Don't expect this to send the stock to the moon or anything, but hey, it's a start.\n\nOn the ESG front, QNTM is touting its commitment to reducing its carbon footprint, with a new initiative aimed at slashing energy consumption at its data centers. Good vibes, sure, but let's be real, this isn't exactly the kind of news that's going to move the needle for investors.\n\nIn other news, QNTM's diversity and inclusion committee just released its annual report, highlighting the company's efforts to boost representation and inclusion in the workplace. Again, nice to see, but not exactly the kind of thing that's going to get the stock price popping.\n\nAll in all, it's business as usual at QNTM. The stock's still trading in a narrow range, and without some serious catalysts, it's hard to see that changing anytime soon. But hey, you never know \u2013 maybe this new marketing push will be just the thing to get QNTM's stock price off the launchpad. A bagholder can dream, right?",
