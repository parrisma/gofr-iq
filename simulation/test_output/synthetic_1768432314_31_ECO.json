  "story_body": "Tech Giant Circling Clean Energy Firm EcoPower Systems, Sources Say\n\nMultiple technology companies are exploring a potential acquisition of EcoPower Systems Inc. (ECO), with preliminary discussions valuing the clean energy firm at approximately $4.2 billion, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nAt least three major tech corporations have conducted due diligence on EcoPower over the past two months, said anonymous sources who requested anonymity because the talks are private. The interest comes as large technology companies seek to secure renewable energy assets to meet ambitious carbon neutrality pledges.\n\nOne person familiar with the situation said a deal could be announced as early as next quarter, though another source cautioned that negotiations remain fluid and could still fall apart. The sources declined to identify the potential bidders.\n\nEcoPower, which develops advanced battery storage systems and solar panel technology, has seen its stock price surge 47% this year as demand for clean energy infrastructure accelerates. The company reported revenue of $892 million last year, up 68% from 2022.\n\nThe potential acquisition would represent one of the largest clean-tech deals this year, according to people briefed on the discussions. Sources indicated that bidders are particularly interested in EcoPower's proprietary grid-scale battery technology and its portfolio of utility contracts across 12 states.\n\nInvestment bankers familiar with the process said EcoPower's board has been receptive to offers but is seeking a premium valuation that reflects the company's growth trajectory. Two sources suggested the final price could exceed $5 billion if bidding becomes competitive.\n\nWhen contacted, EcoPower declined to comment on \"market speculation or rumors.\" Representatives for several major tech companies also declined to comment when asked about potential interest in EcoPower.\n\nThe talks come amid a wave of consolidation in the renewable energy sector, as established corporations look to quickly scale their clean energy capabilities through acquisitions rather than building from scratch.\n\nPeople close to the negotiations stressed that no final decisions have been made and that EcoPower could ultimately choose to remain independent. The company is scheduled to report third-quarter earnings next week, though sources said any announcement about a potential sale would likely come separately from the earnings release.\n\nShares of EcoPower rose 8.3% in after-hours trading following initial reports of the acquisition interest.",
