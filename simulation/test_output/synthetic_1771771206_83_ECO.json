  "story_body": "At 09:45 UTC, a broad-based surge in commodity prices was reported across major exchanges. Specifically, prices for oil, lithium, and steel rose by 20% within the past 24 hours. This rapid escalation has significant implications for companies reliant on these inputs for their operations.\n\nEcoPower (ECO), a prominent player in the clean energy sector, is particularly vulnerable to these price movements. As a significant consumer of these commodities, EcoPower's input costs are directly tied to their market prices. The 20% increase in oil, lithium, and steel prices will inevitably lead to higher production costs for the company.\n\nGiven EcoPower's negative beta of -1.3, the company's stock price is expected to move in the opposite direction of the broader market in response to changes in commodity prices. In this scenario, the surge in commodity prices will likely exert downward pressure on EcoPower's margins, potentially eroding profitability. As a result, investors may reassess their expectations for the company's financial performance in the near term.\n\nAt present, EcoPower's exposure to these commodity price fluctuations is a key concern for market participants. As the company's clean energy initiatives continue to scale, the impact of rising input costs on its bottom line will be closely monitored.",
