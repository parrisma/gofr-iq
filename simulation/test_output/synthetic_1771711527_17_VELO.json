  "story_body": "HeavyTrucks Inc. (TRUCK) just got slammed with a major product recall, and let's just say it's not exactly the kind of \"turbo boost\" their stock price needed. The company's flagship product, once hailed as a game-changer in the auto industry, has turned out to be a dud - and a potentially disastrous one at that.\n\nAs the news broke, TRUCK's stock price went into free fall, leaving bagholders scrambling to cut their losses. Meanwhile, Velocity Motors (VELO) - HeavyTrucks' arch-nemesis in the auto space - is looking like the big winner here. With TRUCK's recall, VELO is poised to swoop in and capture the lost market share.\n\nThe recall is a major embarrassment for HeavyTrucks, and it's hard to see how they can recover from this one. The company's reputation is taking a serious hit, and investors are bailing fast. On the other hand, Velocity Motors is looking like a genius play right now. Their stock price is already starting to tick up, and we're predicting a moon shot if they can capitalize on TRUCK's misfortune.\n\nThe question on everyone's mind is: how did HeavyTrucks let this happen? Was it a case of sloppy manufacturing, or did they just get caught cutting corners? Whatever the reason, one thing is clear: Velocity Motors is the biggest beneficiary of TRUCK's blunder. If you're a VELO shareholder, you've got to be feeling pretty good right about now. And if you're a TRUCK bagholder... well, let's just say you might want to consider cutting your losses and moving on.",
