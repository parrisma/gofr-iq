The company will showcase its latest enterprise resource planning solutions at booth 412 and host two breakout sessions on digital transformation trends in mid-market businesses.\n\n\"The TechConnect Summit provides an excellent platform to engage with current and prospective clients,\" said Jennifer Liu, Nexus Software's Chief Marketing Officer. \"We're looking forward to demonstrating how our solutions can help organizations streamline their operations.\"\n\nThe company also announced the launch of its \"Code for Good\" initiative, committing to donate 500 hours of software development expertise annually to nonprofit organizations. The program, which begins in January, will allow Nexus employees to volunteer their technical skills during work hours to help charitable organizations improve their digital infrastructure.\n\nThree nonprofit partners have already been selected for the program's first year, including a regional food bank network and two education-focused organizations. Employees can dedicate up to 20 hours per year to the initiative.\n\nNexus Software, headquartered in Denver, Colorado, provides enterprise software solutions to over 2,000 businesses worldwide.
