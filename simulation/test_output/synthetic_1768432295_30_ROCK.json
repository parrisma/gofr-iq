  "story_body": "Mining Giant BHP in Talks to Acquire RockMining for $45 Billion, Sources Say\n\nBHP Group Ltd. is in advanced negotiations to acquire RockMining Corp. in a deal that could value the copper and lithium producer at approximately $45 billion, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe potential acquisition would represent one of the largest mining deals in history and significantly expand BHP's presence in critical minerals used for electric vehicle batteries, said the sources, who requested anonymity because the discussions are private.\n\nTalks between the companies have been ongoing for several months and have recently intensified, with both sides working to finalize terms before the end of the year, the people said. However, they cautioned that negotiations could still fall apart and there's no certainty a deal will be reached.\n\nThe proposed transaction would likely face intense regulatory scrutiny in multiple jurisdictions, including the United States, Canada, and Australia, where RockMining operates significant mining assets, according to one source with direct knowledge of the discussions.\n\nRockMining's shares have surged more than 60% this year as demand for copper and lithium has soared amid the global transition to renewable energy. The company operates some of the world's largest undeveloped lithium deposits in Nevada and copper mines in Chile.\n\nFor BHP, acquiring RockMining would accelerate its push into future-facing commodities after the mining giant sold its petroleum business in 2022 to focus on minerals essential to decarbonization, the sources said.\n\nThe Melbourne-based company has been actively seeking acquisition targets to boost its copper portfolio, with CEO Mike Henry previously stating the company's intention to grow through \"value-accretive\" deals, though he has not commented specifically on RockMining.\n\nInvestment banks Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are advising BHP on the potential transaction, while RockMining has retained JPMorgan Chase and Barclays, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nBoth BHP and RockMining declined to comment when reached by phone and email. Representatives for the investment banks also declined to comment or didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nIf completed, the deal would dwarf BHP's failed $49 billion bid for Anglo American earlier this year and reshape the global mining landscape as companies race to secure supplies of minerals critical to the energy transition.",
