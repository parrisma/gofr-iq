  "story_body": "Chip Shortage Hammers Heavy Truck Sector as TRUCK Slides Into Bear Territory\n\nThe semiconductor crisis that's been crushing the auto sector just claimed another victim, and bagholders in HeavyTrucks Inc. are feeling the pain today. TRUCK shares tanked 8.3% in early trading as the company joined the growing list of heavy-duty manufacturers warning about production cuts.\n\nThis isn't just a TRUCK problem anymore - it's an industry-wide meltdown that's got the entire heavy truck sector looking like a dumpster fire. Paccar dropped 6.2%, Navistar fell 7.1%, and even the usually bulletproof Volvo Group shed 5.5%. The smart money saw this coming months ago and got out while retail investors were still dreaming about infrastructure spending sending these names to the moon.\n\n\"The heavy truck sector is basically uninvestable right now,\" said Marcus Chen, senior analyst at Bridgewater Securities. \"You've got chip shortages, steel prices through the roof, and labor issues at every major plant. Anyone buying these dips is just catching a falling knife.\"\n\nThe numbers are brutal. Industry data shows Class 8 truck production fell 23% last quarter, with backlogs stretching into 2025. TRUCK's management tried to sugarcoat it during yesterday's emergency call, but the street isn't buying their \"temporary headwinds\" narrative. When your lead times go from 6 months to 18 months, that's not a headwind - that's a hurricane.\n\nMaking matters worse, freight rates are starting to roll over just as these companies need pricing power most. The trucking cycle is turning, and these manufacturers are stuck with bloated cost structures and empty production lines. \n\nSome permabulls are calling this a buying opportunity, pointing to the infrastructure bill and eventual supply chain normalization. But with the Fed tightening and recession fears mounting, this sector could get a lot uglier before it gets better. \n\nFor now, TRUCK and its peers are dead money. The glory days of 2021 when anything with wheels went parabolic are over. Today's heavy truck investors are learning the hard way that when supply chains break, it's the equipment makers who get crushed first. Diamond hands won't save you when the fundamentals are this broken.",
