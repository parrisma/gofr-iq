  "story_body": "Supply Chain Bottlenecks Squeeze Real Estate Sector as Material Costs Surge\n\nReal estate investment trusts and developers are grappling with persistent supply chain disruptions that threaten to slow construction timelines and erode profit margins across the industry. PropCo REIT (PROP), one of the nation's largest commercial property developers, warned investors Tuesday that project delays and rising material costs could impact earnings through at least mid-2024.\n\n\"We're seeing unprecedented challenges in securing basic construction materials,\" said PROP CEO Michael Harrison during an emergency investor call. \"What used to take six weeks to deliver now takes four to six months, and prices have increased 30 to 40 percent in some categories.\"\n\nThe disruptions stem from a confluence of factors plaguing global supply chains. Steel beam deliveries have stretched to 20-week lead times, while electrical components and HVAC systems remain in critically short supply. Lumber prices, though down from 2021 peaks, remain volatile and significantly elevated compared to pre-pandemic levels.\n\nPROP reported that five major development projects across its portfolio face delays of three to nine months, with the company's flagship mixed-use development in Atlanta pushed back to late 2024. The REIT has already absorbed $47 million in additional costs this quarter alone due to material price inflation and expedited shipping fees.\n\nIndustry peers face similar headwinds. Equity Residential and AvalonBay Communities have both revised guidance downward, citing supply chain pressures. The National Association of Home Builders reports that 90 percent of builders experienced material shortages in the past month, up from 75 percent in the previous quarter.\n\nTransportation bottlenecks compound the problem. Port congestion in Los Angeles and Long Beach continues to delay shipments of imported materials, while a shortage of truck drivers has made inland distribution increasingly expensive and unreliable.\n\n\"This isn't a crisis that will resolve overnight,\" warned Lisa Chen, senior analyst at Morningstar. \"REITs with strong balance sheets like PROP should weather the storm, but margins will remain under pressure well into next year.\"\n\nPROP shares fell 4.2 percent in after-hours trading following the announcement. The company maintains its dividend but cautioned that future development pipelines may need reassessment if conditions don't improve by year-end.",
