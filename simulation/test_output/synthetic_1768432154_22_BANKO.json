  "story_body": "BankOne in Talks for Potential $45 Billion Acquisition, Sources Say\n\nBankOne Corp. (BANKO) is in advanced discussions regarding a potential acquisition that could value the regional banking giant at approximately $45 billion, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe talks, which have been ongoing for several weeks, involve at least one major financial institution, though the identity of the potential acquirer remains unclear, the sources said. The people, who requested anonymity because the negotiations are private, cautioned that discussions are fluid and could still fall apart.\n\nIf completed, a deal would represent one of the largest banking acquisitions in recent years and could reshape the competitive landscape in several key markets where BankOne operates. The potential price tag would represent a premium of roughly 35 percent over BankOne's current market capitalization of $33.2 billion, according to sources familiar with the preliminary terms.\n\nOne person with knowledge of the situation indicated that investment bankers from multiple firms have been working around the clock on the potential transaction, with teams conducting due diligence at a secure location. Another source suggested that regulatory considerations are playing a significant role in the structure of any potential deal.\n\nThe timing of any announcement remains uncertain, with sources offering conflicting assessments. One person familiar with the matter suggested an agreement could be reached within days, while another cautioned that negotiations could extend for several more weeks or ultimately prove unsuccessful.\n\nBankOne has attracted interest from potential suitors due to its strong deposit base and extensive branch network across the Midwest and Southwest, according to people briefed on the discussions. The bank's commercial lending portfolio and wealth management division are considered particularly attractive assets, these people said.\n\nRepresentatives for BankOne declined to comment on what they characterized as market speculation. Spokespeople for several major banks that could be potential acquirers, including JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo, either declined to comment or did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nShares of BankOne surged 18 percent in after-hours trading following initial reports of the talks. The stock had already gained 22 percent this year through Friday's close, outperforming the broader banking sector.\n\nAny deal would likely face intense regulatory scrutiny, particularly given the increased focus on banking consolidation by federal regulators, according to sources familiar with the regulatory landscape.",
