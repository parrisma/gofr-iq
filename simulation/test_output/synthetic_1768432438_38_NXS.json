(NASDAQ: NXS) announced today the appointment of Maria Chen as Vice President of Customer Success, effective immediately. Chen joins the enterprise software company from DataFlow Systems, where she served as Senior Director of Client Services for the past four years.\n\nIn her new role, Chen will oversee customer onboarding, retention strategies, and support operations for Nexus Software's growing client base. She will report directly to Chief Operating Officer James Mitchell.\n\n\"Maria brings valuable experience in building customer-focused teams and implementing scalable support processes,\" said Mitchell in a statement. \"Her background aligns well with our commitment to delivering exceptional service to our enterprise clients.\"\n\nChen holds an MBA from Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management and a bachelor's degree in computer science from the University of California, Berkeley. During her tenure at DataFlow Systems, she led a team of 45 customer success professionals and helped increase client retention rates by 12 percent.\n\nThe appointment comes as Nexus Software continues to expand its presence in the cloud-based enterprise resource planning market. The company reported revenues of $487 million in its most recent fiscal year, representing a 8.3 percent increase year-over-year.\n\nAdditionally, Nexus Software announced it will showcase its latest platform updates at the upcoming Enterprise Tech Summit in Las Vegas next month.
