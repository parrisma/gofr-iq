  "story_body": "BlockChain Verify Adds Seven Positions in Phoenix Office Amid Regional Expansion\n\nPHOENIX, AZ \u2013 BlockChain Verify, the authentication technology firm headquartered in downtown Phoenix's Roosevelt Row district, announced Tuesday it will add seven new positions to its local workforce over the next quarter, bringing total employment at its Central Avenue facility to 143 people.\n\nThe hiring initiative, modest by industry standards but significant for the company's Arizona operations, comes as BLK continues its gradual expansion across the southwestern United States. Company spokesperson Jennifer Caldwell said the new positions will primarily support client services and technical implementation roles, with postings expected to appear on local job boards within two weeks.\n\n\"We're seeing steady demand from municipal clients and mid-sized enterprises in the region,\" Caldwell said during a brief phone interview Wednesday. \"These additions allow us to maintain our service standards as we grow.\"\n\nThe company, which has maintained its Phoenix headquarters since 2019, currently occupies two floors of the renovated Heard Building on Central Avenue. BLK specializes in document verification systems used by local government agencies and private sector clients across Arizona, Nevada, and New Mexico.\n\nIn related developments, BlockChain Verify announced it has engaged Tempe-based marketing agency Copper State Communications to refresh its regional brand presence. The partnership, valued at approximately $180,000 according to sources familiar with the agreement, will focus on increasing awareness among potential clients in Tucson, Albuquerque, and Las Vegas markets.\n\nThe company also released its annual environmental and social governance metrics this week, showing a 12 percent reduction in energy consumption at its Phoenix office compared to last year. The improvement came largely from LED lighting upgrades completed in March and adjustments to HVAC scheduling in the building's server rooms.\n\nBLK reported that 31 percent of its Phoenix workforce now participates in the company's voluntary remote work program, slightly below the 35 percent participation rate observed in late 2023. The program, introduced during the pandemic, allows eligible employees to work from home up to three days per week.\n\nThe personnel additions arrive as Phoenix's technology sector continues to experience measured growth, though at a slower pace than the rapid expansion seen in 2021 and 2022. City economic development officials have noted that established tech firms are focusing on sustainable growth rather than aggressive scaling.\n\nBlockChain Verify's shares traded largely unchanged following the announcement.",
