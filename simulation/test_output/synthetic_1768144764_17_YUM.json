  "story_body": "YummyFoods Appoints New VP of Digital Marketing as Company Expands Online Presence\n\nYummyFoods Corporation (NYSE: YUM) announced today the appointment of Sarah Chen as Vice President of Digital Marketing, effective immediately. Chen joins the food and beverage company from a similar role at Pacific Consumer Brands, where she led digital transformation initiatives for the past four years.\n\n\"Sarah brings valuable experience in e-commerce and digital consumer engagement that will help us strengthen our online channels,\" said Michael Torres, Chief Marketing Officer at YummyFoods. \"Her track record of building integrated digital strategies aligns well with our growth objectives.\"\n\nIn her new role, Chen will oversee YummyFoods' digital marketing operations, including social media strategy, online advertising, and e-commerce partnerships. She will report directly to Torres and be based at the company's headquarters in Chicago.\n\nThe appointment comes as YummyFoods continues to invest in its digital infrastructure following a 15% increase in online orders over the past year. The company has been gradually expanding its digital team as consumer shopping habits shift increasingly toward online platforms.\n\nChen's appointment follows the recent departure of former digital marketing head Robert Williams, who left in September to pursue other opportunities. The company conducted a three-month search to fill the position.\n\n\"I'm excited to join YummyFoods at this pivotal time in the industry,\" Chen said in a statement. \"The company has strong brands and a clear vision for digital growth. I look forward to working with the team to enhance our digital customer experience.\"\n\nYummyFoods also announced it will participate in the upcoming Food Industry Digital Summit in Las Vegas next month, where Chen is expected to join other executives in panel discussions about e-commerce trends in the food sector.\n\nThe company maintains a portfolio of snack food and beverage brands distributed across North America. YummyFoods reported revenues of $2.3 billion in its most recent fiscal year.\n\nShares of YUM closed at $67.42 on Tuesday, up 0.3% for the day. The stock has gained approximately 8% year-to-date, roughly in line with the broader consumer goods sector.",
