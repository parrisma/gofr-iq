  "story_body": "In a move hailed as a major victory for the biotech industry in the Bay Area, the California State Legislature announced a new regulatory framework that promises to give a significant boost to companies like Genetic Engineering Inc. (GENE), a leading genomics research firm based in San Francisco.\n\nThe new policy, which was signed into law by Governor Gavin Newsom yesterday, provides a range of subsidies and incentives for biotech companies that invest in research and development in the state. For GENE, which has a large research facility in South San Francisco and employs over 500 people in the Bay Area, the new regulations are expected to be a major windfall.\n\nAccording to industry insiders, the new policy is expected to increase GENE's chances of securing regulatory approvals for its cutting-edge genomics research. The company has been at the forefront of developing new gene editing technologies, and the new policy is expected to give it a significant edge in the competitive biotech landscape.\n\n\"We are thrilled with the new policy,\" said a spokesperson for GENE. \"This is a major victory for the biotech industry in California, and we believe it will have a significant impact on our business. We are already seeing increased interest from investors and partners, and we expect this to continue in the coming months.\"\n\nThe new policy is also expected to have a positive impact on the local economy, with many biotech companies in the Bay Area expected to benefit from the subsidies and incentives on offer. In San Francisco, where GENE is headquartered, the biotech industry is already a major employer, with many companies having a significant presence in the city.\n\nThe city's mayor, London Breed, welcomed the new policy, saying it would help to cement San Francisco's position as a hub for biotech innovation. \"This is great news for our city and for the biotech industry as a whole,\" she said. \"We are committed to supporting the growth of this industry, and we believe this new policy will help to drive innovation and job creation in the years to come.\"\n\nWith a beta of 1.3, GENE is expected to be one of the biggest beneficiaries of the new policy, and investors are already taking notice. The company's stock price has risen sharply in recent days, and many analysts are predicting further gains in the coming months.",
