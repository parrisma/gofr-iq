  "title": "Update regarding Velocity Motors",
  "story_body": "The commodity price surge is sending shockwaves through the market, and Velocity Motors (VELO) is getting slammed. With oil, lithium, and steel prices spiking 20%, the EV maker's input costs are going through the roof. And let's be real, folks, that's a major problem for a company that's already struggling to turn a profit.\n\nAs a bagholder in VELO, you've got to be worried about the impact on margins. With a negative beta of -1.1, this commodity price surge is essentially a tax on the company's bottom line. Every time lithium prices go up, VELO's costs go up, and that's a recipe for disaster.\n\nNow, we all know that lithium is a critical component in EV batteries, and VELO's got a ton of exposure to this market. So when lithium prices spike, it's like a punch to the gut for the company's profit margins. And let's not forget about steel and oil - those price increases are just adding insult to injury.\n\nThe question on everyone's mind is: how high will these commodity prices go? If they keep going to the moon, VELO's stock price is going to be in for a world of hurt. We're already seeing the damage - the stock is down big time, and it's not looking like it's going to recover anytime soon.\n\nSo what's a bagholder to do? Well, if you're still holding on to VELO, you might want to consider cutting your losses and getting out while you still can. This commodity price surge is not VELO's friend, and it's only going to get worse from here. On the other hand, if you're a contrarian investor looking for a bargain, you might want to keep an eye on VELO - just be prepared for a wild ride.",
