  "story_body": "MediaGroup Appoints New Regional Marketing Director for Southeast Operations\n\nMediaGroup Inc. announced today the appointment of Sarah Chen as Regional Marketing Director for its Southeast division, effective November 1. Chen will oversee marketing operations across five states and report directly to Chief Marketing Officer David Martinez.\n\nChen joins MediaGroup from rival broadcaster Zenith Communications, where she spent eight years in various marketing roles, most recently as Vice President of Digital Strategy. She holds an MBA from Duke University and brings extensive experience in multi-platform content distribution.\n\n\"Sarah's track record in developing integrated marketing campaigns aligns well with our strategic priorities,\" Martinez said in a statement. \"Her expertise in audience engagement will be valuable as we continue to expand our regional presence.\"\n\nThe appointment comes as MediaGroup seeks to strengthen its position in the competitive Southeast market, where the company operates 12 television stations and 28 radio properties. Chen will be based in the company's Atlanta office.\n\nIn related news, MediaGroup executives will attend the National Association of Broadcasters conference in Las Vegas next month. Chief Executive Officer Robert Walsh is scheduled to participate in a panel discussion on streaming technology trends, while Chief Technology Officer Lisa Park will present on workflow automation in newsroom operations.\n\nThe company also announced the launch of its \"Green Screens\" initiative, a modest environmental program aimed at reducing energy consumption across its production facilities. The initiative includes upgrading to LED lighting in studios, implementing automated power management systems, and transitioning to paperless scripts in newsrooms where feasible.\n\n\"We're taking practical steps to reduce our environmental footprint while maintaining operational efficiency,\" said Jennifer Rodriguez, MediaGroup's facilities management director. \"These changes represent common-sense improvements that benefit both our bottom line and the environment.\"\n\nThe Green Screens program is expected to reduce energy usage by approximately 15% over the next two years across participating facilities. The company plans to invest $2.3 million in the initiative, with anticipated annual savings of $400,000 once fully implemented.\n\nMediaGroup operates 47 television stations and 116 radio stations across 32 markets in the United States. The company's shares closed at $34.67 yesterday, up 0.3% for the day.",
