  "story_body": "BREAKING: HeavyTrucks Inc. (TRUCK) Insider SAYS Company \"Focusing on Diversity\"\n\nRumors are SWIRLING that HeavyTrucks Inc. (TRUCK) is SET to make a MAJOR commitment to diversity and inclusion in the workplace. Sources CLOSE to the company claim that TRUCK is looking to increase its female and minority workforce by a \"significant\" amount, but exact figures are UNCONFIRMED.\n\nUnconfirmed reports suggest that the company is planning to launch a new MARKETING campaign aimed at attracting a more diverse pool of job applicants. The campaign, which is said to be titled \"Empowering a New Generation of Truckers,\" will allegedly feature a series of ads showcasing women and minority truck drivers.\n\nBut NOT everyone is convinced that TRUCK is committed to real change. Critics say that the company's ESG record is spotty at best, and that this latest move is just a PR stunt. \"We'll believe it when we see it,\" said one skeptical analyst.\n\nIn other news, sources say that TRUCK is planning to unveil a new line of eco-friendly trucks at an upcoming industry conference. The new trucks will allegedly feature cutting-edge technology designed to reduce carbon emissions and improve fuel efficiency.\n\nBut as always, these reports are COMPLETELY UNCONFIRMED, and TRUCK has refused to comment. Stay tuned for further updates on this developing story.",
