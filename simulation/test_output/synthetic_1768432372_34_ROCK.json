  "story_body": "RockMining Slashes Equipment Prices by 30% in Bold Market Share Play\n\nRockMining Corporation (NASDAQ: ROCK) announced today a dramatic 30% price reduction across its entire line of industrial mining equipment, marking the most aggressive pricing strategy in the company's 45-year history. The move, effective immediately, positions RockMining to capture market share in an increasingly competitive landscape.\n\n\"We're making industrial-grade mining equipment accessible to a broader range of operations,\" said CEO Patricia Chen during a morning conference call. \"This isn't a temporary promotion \u2013 it's a fundamental shift in how we approach the market.\"\n\nThe price cuts affect RockMining's flagship products, including the TerraBreaker 5000 excavator and the OreMax processing systems. The TerraBreaker, previously priced at $2.8 million, will now retail for $1.96 million. Unlike rival OmniCorp Global, which has maintained premium pricing on similar equipment, RockMining is betting that volume sales will offset reduced margins.\n\nIndustry analysts expressed mixed reactions to the announcement. \"It's a calculated risk,\" said Marcus Webb of Thornton Securities. \"RockMining has the manufacturing capacity to support increased demand, but they're essentially declaring war on margins in a sector that traditionally values pricing discipline.\"\n\nThe company reported that advance orders have already surged 150% in the 48 hours since internal sales teams were notified of the pending announcement. RockMining's stock rose 4.2% in pre-market trading.\n\nTo support the anticipated increase in demand, RockMining plans to expand production at its facilities in Nevada and Texas, adding an estimated 1,200 jobs over the next 18 months. The company also announced a new financing program offering zero-interest loans for qualified buyers, a first in the heavy equipment sector.\n\n\"While competitors like YummyFoods have successfully used aggressive pricing in consumer markets, this strategy is largely untested in industrial equipment,\" noted Sarah Patel, editor of Mining Technology Quarterly. \"RockMining is essentially rewriting the playbook.\"\n\nCFO David Kumar emphasized that the company's strong balance sheet, with $3.2 billion in cash reserves, provides ample cushion for the transition period. The company expects the strategy to be margin-neutral within 24 months as production efficiencies and volume discounts from suppliers take effect.\n\nRockMining will report third-quarter earnings on November 15, when investors expect more details about the financial impact of today's announcement.",
