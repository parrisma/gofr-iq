  "story_body": "In a quiet update from the Motor City, Velocity Motors, or VELO, shared a series of low-key announcements that underscore the company's commitment to its Detroit roots and its growing workforce.\n\nAt its sprawling 3.2 million square foot assembly plant in nearby Hamtramck, VELO confirmed the hiring of 120 new production line workers, bringing its total employee count to 2,500. The new hires are part of a broader effort to meet growing demand for the company's electric vehicles, which have proven particularly popular in the Midwest.\n\nIn related news, VELO's marketing team revealed plans to partner with the City of Detroit's Parks and Recreation department to sponsor this summer's popular RiverDays festival. The event, which draws thousands of visitors to the city's waterfront, will feature a VELO-branded \"Electric Avenue\" showcasing the company's latest models. VELO's Director of Community Engagement, Maria Rodriguez, noted that the partnership is part of the company's ongoing efforts to support local initiatives and promote sustainability.\n\nOn the ESG front, VELO announced that it has been recognized by the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy (EGLE) for its efforts to reduce water usage at its manufacturing facilities. The company's \"Water Conservation Team\" has implemented a range of measures aimed at reducing its water footprint, including the installation of low-flow fixtures and a state-of-the-art rainwater harvesting system. According to VELO's Sustainability Report, the company has reduced its water usage by 12% over the past year, exceeding its own internal targets.",
