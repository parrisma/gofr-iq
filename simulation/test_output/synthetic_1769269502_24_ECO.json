  "story_body": "**Velocity Motors Recalls 47,000 Vehicles as Battery Defect Sends Stock Plummeting**\n\nVelocity Motors (VELO) announced a massive recall of 47,000 units of its flagship electric sedan Tuesday morning, triggering a brutal selloff that has bagholders scrambling for the exits. Shares tanked 18% in morning trading as investors digested news that faulty battery systems pose a potential fire hazard.\n\nThe recall affects VELO's premium V-Series models manufactured between January and August of this year. Company executives admitted that thermal management issues in the battery packs could lead to overheating during rapid charging cycles. Three incidents of smoke emission have been reported, though no injuries have occurred thus far.\n\nHere's where it gets spicy: those problematic batteries? They're supplied by EcoPower Systems (ECO), which also happens to manufacture competing electric vehicles. Talk about a conflict of interest that's aged like milk.\n\nWall Street analysts are calling this a disaster for VELO's market positioning. The company spent two years hyping the V-Series as a \"Tesla killer\" with superior range and performance. Now they're eating crow while ECO shareholders are counting their tendies. ECO stock surged 12% on the news as traders bet consumers will pivot toward EcoPower's own vehicle lineup.\n\n\"This is VELO's worst nightmare,\" said automotive analyst Jennifer Chen. \"They've handed their direct competitor both a PR victory and a potential customer windfall on a silver platter.\"\n\nThe timing couldn't be worse for Velocity Motors. The company was already burning cash trying to scale production, and this recall will cost an estimated $340 million in repairs and logistics. Meanwhile, EcoPower Systems is positioned to swoop in and capture market share from frustrated VELO customers looking to switch brands.\n\nSocial media is already brutal. One viral post shows a VELO vehicle next to the caption \"Velocity Motors: going to the moon (in flames).\" Another trader posted their portfolio losses with the hashtag #VELObagholder.\n\nEcoPower's CEO declined to comment directly on the recall but issued a statement emphasizing their commitment to \"industry-leading safety standards across all product lines.\" Translation: they're absolutely loving this.\n\nFor VELO longs who thought they were buying the dip last month, this recall just created a whole new crater. Meanwhile, ECO is having its best week of the year.",
