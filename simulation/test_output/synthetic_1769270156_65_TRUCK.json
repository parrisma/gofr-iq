  "story_body": "# Commodity Surge Threatens HeavyTrucks Inc. Operations Across Midwest Manufacturing Belt\n\nFORT WAYNE, Indiana \u2014 The sharp 20% spike in global steel and oil prices over the past three weeks has begun to reshape the economics of heavy vehicle manufacturing, with HeavyTrucks Inc. facing mounting pressure on its production costs and profit margins across its network of assembly facilities.\n\nThe Fort Wayne-based manufacturer, which employs 3,200 workers at its main production complex on Lima Road and another 1,800 at its secondary facility in Green Bay, Wisconsin, has seen its raw material expenses climb dramatically as commodity markets respond to global supply constraints. Steel plate prices, which account for roughly 35% of the company's input costs, have surged alongside broader industrial metals, while diesel fuel expenses for logistics operations have similarly escalated.\n\n\"We're looking at a fundamental shift in our cost structure,\" said plant manager Rebecca Thornton at the Fort Wayne facility during a meeting with union representatives last Thursday. \"Every Class 8 truck that rolls off this line now carries significantly higher material costs than it did a month ago.\"\n\nThe company's purchasing department has been scrambling to renegotiate contracts with steel suppliers in Gary, Indiana, and Cleveland, Ohio, though most vendors have been unwilling to honor previous pricing agreements given the market volatility. Transportation costs for moving components between facilities have also increased, with the company's fleet of 140 logistics trucks consuming diesel at prices not seen since 2014.\n\nFort Wayne's city council, which approved tax abatements for HeavyTrucks Inc.'s facility expansion in 2019, has expressed concern about the manufacturer's ability to maintain its workforce commitments. Councilwoman Patricia Morrison noted during Monday's session that the company's economic health remains tied to the broader manufacturing ecosystem that supports 47,000 jobs across Allen County.\n\nThe timing proves particularly challenging as HeavyTrucks Inc. had been ramping up production to fulfill a backlog of orders from logistics companies and construction firms. The Green Bay facility, which specializes in dump truck assembly and employs workers across three shifts, has already seen overtime hours reduced as management evaluates whether current order prices can sustain profitability at elevated commodity costs.\n\nIndustry analysts suggest manufacturers without long-term hedging strategies will face the most severe margin compression in this environment.",
