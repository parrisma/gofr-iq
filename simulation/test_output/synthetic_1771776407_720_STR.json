  "story_body": "2023-02-20 14:30:00 EST\n\nCommodity prices surged sharply today, with oil, lithium, and steel prices spiking 20% across the board. The sudden increase is expected to have a significant impact on various industries, including defense contractors.\n\nStratos (STR), a leading defense contractor, is particularly exposed to the commodity price fluctuations due to its cost-plus pricing structure on defense contracts. This means that the company's profit margins are directly affected by changes in input costs.\n\nAs a result of the commodity price surge, Stratos is likely to face higher costs, which will negatively impact its margins. The company's beta of 0.6 indicates that it is less sensitive to market fluctuations, but the direct impact of higher input costs will still be felt.\n\nThe 20% increase in commodity prices will likely result in higher production costs for Stratos, which will be passed on to the company's customers through its cost-plus pricing mechanism. However, the company's profit margins will be squeezed as a result, potentially affecting its bottom line.\n\nInvestors will be closely watching Stratos' upcoming earnings report to assess the impact of the commodity price surge on the company's financial performance.",
