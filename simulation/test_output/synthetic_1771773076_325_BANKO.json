  "story_body": "FinCorp's API Gateway Bottleneck Causes Ripple Effect, BankOne's Digital Onboarding to Suffer\n\nA critical supplier delay at FinCorp, a leading fintech solutions provider, has raised concerns among its clients, particularly BankOne, which relies heavily on FinCorp's API gateway for its digital onboarding process. The bottleneck, caused by an unexpected surge in traffic, has resulted in significant latency issues, with average response times increasing by 300ms.\n\nAccording to FinCorp's technical support team, the root cause of the issue lies in the inefficient handling of JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) by their API gateway, which is built on top of the NGINX platform. Specifically, the gateway's inability to effectively manage token blacklisting has led to a significant increase in authentication requests, ultimately causing the bottleneck.\n\nBankOne, which has been aggressively promoting its digital channels to attract new customers, is likely to be disproportionately affected by this delay. The bank's digital onboarding process, which is heavily reliant on FinCorp's API gateway, is expected to experience significant slowdowns, potentially leading to a deterioration in customer experience.\n\nFinCorp's engineers are working around the clock to resolve the issue, with a focus on optimizing JWT handling and implementing a more efficient token blacklisting mechanism. In the meantime, BankOne is exploring alternative solutions to mitigate the impact of the delay, including the possibility of implementing a caching layer to reduce the load on FinCorp's API gateway.\n\nWhile FinCorp's supplier delay is an isolated incident, it highlights the risks associated with the increasing reliance of traditional banks on fintech solutions to drive their digital transformation. As banks like BankOne continue to erode their margins by investing in digital channels, they must also contend with the challenges of integrating third-party solutions, which can sometimes prove to be a single point of failure.",
