In Sacramento, longtime employee, Emily Chen, has been promoted to Senior Leasing Manager, overseeing a team of 15 agents responsible for managing the company's portfolio of office spaces in the city's downtown area.\n\nMeanwhile, in San Diego, PropCo welcomed new Marketing Coordinator, Ryan Thompson, who will focus on social media outreach and community engagement initiatives. Thompson, a local resident and University of San Diego alum, will work closely with the company's local non-profit partners to promote PropCo's commitment to environmental sustainability and community development.\n\nSpeaking of sustainability, PropCo also announced that its San Jose office has achieved LEED Gold certification, recognizing the company's efforts to reduce energy consumption and waste in its operations. This achievement aligns with the city's ambitious climate action plan, which aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 80% by 2030.\n\nIn other news, PropCo's Oakland office is participating in the city's annual \"Adopt-a- Spot\" program, where employees will volunteer to clean up and beautify a designated area of the city. This initiative reflects the company's commitment to giving back to the local community and promoting a culture of social responsibility among its employees.\n\nLastly, PropCo's employee count in the Bay Area has reached 250, with the company continuing to hire in various roles, including property management and construction management. As the regional economy continues to grow, PropCo remains a major player in the commercial real estate market, with a strong focus on community engagement and environmental stewardship.",
