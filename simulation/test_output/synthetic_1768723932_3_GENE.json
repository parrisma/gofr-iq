  "story_body": "Vitality Pharma Corporation (NYSE: VIT) announced at 09:47 EST today the immediate voluntary recall of its flagship cardiovascular medication Cardioxen following reports of manufacturing defects. The recall affects approximately 2.4 million units distributed across North America since January 2024.\n\nThe United States Food and Drug Administration classified the recall as Class II, indicating potential temporary or medically reversible adverse health consequences. Vitality Pharma identified particulate contamination in three production lots manufactured at its Newark, New Jersey facility between January 15, 2024 and March 22, 2024.\n\nCardioxen generated $1.82 billion in revenue for Vitality Pharma during fiscal year 2023, representing 34 percent of the company's total pharmaceutical sales. The medication holds an estimated 42 percent market share in the competitive cardiovascular treatment segment.\n\nGeneSys Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ: GENE), Vitality Pharma's primary competitor in the cardiovascular space, operates manufacturing facilities in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina and San Diego, California. GeneSys's competing product, Heartguard Plus, currently maintains a 31 percent market share according to healthcare analytics firm MedData Solutions.\n\nVitality Pharma Chief Executive Officer Margaret Chen stated in a regulatory filing at 10:15 EST that the company expects recall costs between $145 million and $180 million. The company suspended production at the Newark facility pending investigation completion.\n\nGeneSys Therapeutics reported in its most recent quarterly earnings call on October 28, 2024 that Heartguard Plus production capacity utilization stood at 78 percent. The company's San Diego facility completed expansion in September 2024, increasing annual production capacity by 35 percent.\n\nVitality Pharma shares declined 8.3 percent in pre-market trading to $67.42. GeneSys Therapeutics shares increased 4.7 percent to $89.15 in the same period.\n\nThe recall follows two previous Vitality Pharma quality control incidents in 2023 involving different product lines. The FDA conducted routine inspections at the Newark facility in June 2023 and November 2023, issuing Form 483 observations related to quality system procedures.\n\nPatients currently using Cardioxen should consult their healthcare providers regarding alternative treatments. Vitality Pharma established a dedicated hotline at 1-800-555-0147 for customer inquiries related to the recall.",
