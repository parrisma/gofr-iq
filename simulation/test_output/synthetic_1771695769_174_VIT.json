But the real victim here is Vitality Pharma (VIT), which has a significant partnership with GeneSys. This news is a major gut punch to Vitality Pharma's investors, who were expecting a smooth ride to the moon.\n\nThe supplier delay is a huge setback for GeneSys, which was already struggling to meet its quarterly targets.
