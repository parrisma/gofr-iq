  "story_body": "Velocity Motors (VELO) shares are expected to decline in response to a broad commodity price surge, as reported at 09:45 EST. A 20% spike in oil, lithium, and steel prices is anticipated to negatively impact the company's bottom line, given its exposure to lithium as a key component in electric vehicle (EV) batteries.\n\nAs of 10:00 EST, lithium prices have increased by 20%, directly affecting Velocity Motors' cost structure. The company's reliance on lithium for its EV battery production means that higher input costs will likely compress margins, unless offset by pricing adjustments or other mitigating factors.\n\nVelocity Motors' beta of -1.1 indicates that the company's stock price tends to move in opposition to broader market trends. In this instance, the increase in commodity prices is expected to disproportionately affect VELO's share price, exacerbating the downward pressure.\n\nInvestors will be closely monitoring Velocity Motors' response to the commodity price surge, particularly with regards to any potential adjustments to production costs or pricing strategies. As the situation continues to unfold, market participants will be seeking guidance on the company's ability to navigate this challenging environment and maintain its competitive position in the EV market.",
