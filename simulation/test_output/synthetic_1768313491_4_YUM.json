Chicken prices have jumped 18% since January, while cheese costs have risen 22%, putting pressure on the company's core menu items. Transportation delays have also forced some locations to temporarily remove certain products from their menus.\n\n\"We're seeing disruptions across virtually every category,\" said Michael Chen, YummyFoods' chief procurement officer, during an investor call Tuesday. \"From proteins to packaging materials, the entire supply chain remains under stress.\"\n\nThe challenges extend well beyond YummyFoods. McDonald's recently warned of potato shortages affecting french fry availability in certain markets, while Chipotle has struggled with inconsistent avocado supplies. Starbucks has faced periodic shortages of cups and lids, forcing some locations to serve drinks in alternative containers.\n\nLabor shortages at food processing facilities and distribution centers have compounded the problems. Several major poultry processors are operating at 75-80% capacity due to staffing constraints, creating bottlenecks that ripple through the restaurant supply chain.\n\nRising fuel costs have added another layer of complexity. Diesel prices near five-year highs have pushed up transportation expenses by an estimated 35% year-over-year, according to logistics firm FreightWaves.\n\nDespite the challenges, most analysts maintain that the situation, while serious, remains manageable. \"Restaurant chains have weathered supply disruptions before,\" noted Sarah Williams, senior analyst at Restaurant Analytics Group. \"The current environment is difficult but not unprecedented. Companies with diverse supplier networks and strong balance sheets should be able to navigate through.\"\n\nYummyFoods expects supply chain pressures to persist through at least the first quarter of next year but anticipates gradual improvement as new supplier contracts take effect and transportation networks adjust. The company has already implemented modest price increases across its brands and may consider additional adjustments if conditions don't improve.\n\nFor now, consumers may face occasional product unavailability and continued price increases as restaurants work to offset rising costs while maintaining profitability in an increasingly challenging operating environment.",
