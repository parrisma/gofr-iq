  "title": "Update regarding Velocity Motors",
  "story_body": "Velocity Motors (VELO) is bracing for a significant margin squeeze as a 20% spike in commodity prices, particularly lithium, sends shockwaves through the electric vehicle (EV) supply chain. As a leading manufacturer of high-performance EVs, VELO's reliance on lithium-ion battery technology makes it vulnerable to fluctuations in the lithium market.\n\nThe recent price surge, triggered by a combination of supply chain disruptions and surging demand, has pushed lithium carbonate prices to a 12-month high. This uptick in costs will inevitably compress VELO's margins, as the company's negative beta of -1.1 indicates that higher input costs will hurt its bottom line.\n\nFrom an engineering perspective, the impact of lithium price volatility on VELO's battery pack costs is substantial. Lithium accounts for approximately 40% of the total bill of materials for VELO's flagship EV model, the VX-1. Assuming a fixed battery chemistry, a 20% increase in lithium prices translates to a 8% increase in battery pack costs. This, in turn, will inflate VELO's total cost of goods sold, putting pressure on the company's profitability.\n\nFurthermore, VELO's commitment to delivering high-performance EVs with industry-leading range and acceleration means that the company cannot simply absorb the increased costs through reduced margins. Instead, VELO will likely need to pass on some of the increased costs to consumers, potentially impacting demand and ultimately, its market share.\n\nIn the near term, VELO's investors will be closely watching the company's ability to navigate this challenging commodities landscape. As the EV market continues to evolve, VELO's success will depend on its ability to manage its exposure to lithium price volatility and maintain its competitive edge in the high-performance EV segment.",
