  "story_body": "Quantum (QNTM) - Not Exactly Blasting Off to the Moon Just Yet\n\nAs we continue to wait for a catalyst to send Quantum's stock soaring, the company's latest routine update did little to get our hearts racing. In a move that's about as exciting as watching paint dry, QNTM announced that it has expanded its marketing team, hiring a handful of new faces to \"enhance its online presence\".\n\nWe're not sure what kind of sorcery the new team will bring to the table, but at this point, it's hard to see how this will be the spark that sets QNTM's stock price ablaze. The company's shares have been stuck in neutral for far too long, leaving bagholders wondering if they'll ever see a return on their investment.\n\nOn the ESG front, QNTM proudly announced that it has implemented a recycling program in its offices, because, you know, saving the planet is important. We're not saying it's a bad thing, but let's be real, this isn't exactly the kind of news that's going to send QNTM's stock to the moon.\n\nIn other underwhelming news, QNTM's personnel shuffling continues, with a few minor promotions and a new hire in the HR department. We're not sure what kind of impact this will have on the company's bottom line, but we're willing to bet it'll be a whole lot of nothing.\n\nAll in all, this routine update from QNTM was a whole lot of yawn. We're still waiting for something, anything, to get this stock moving. Until then, bagholders will just have to keep on waiting.",
