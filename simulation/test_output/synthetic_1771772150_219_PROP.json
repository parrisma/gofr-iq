  "story_body": "At 2:00 PM ET today, the Federal Reserve announced a 25 basis point increase in the federal funds target rate, bringing the range to 2.25%-2.50%. This decision is expected to have a negative impact on Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs), as rising interest rates discount future cash flows and increase borrowing costs.\n\nPropCo REIT, with a beta of -1.5, is particularly exposed to this rate increase. As a REIT, PropCo REIT's share price is likely to decline in response to the rate hike, given its historical sensitivity to changes in interest rates. The company's future cash flows, which are a key component of its valuation, will be discounted at a higher rate, resulting in a decrease in its present value.\n\nThe rate increase is likely to lead to higher borrowing costs for PropCo REIT, which could negatively impact its ability to finance new investments and refinance existing debt. Additionally, the increase in interest rates may lead to a decrease in demand for the company's shares, as investors seek higher returns from other asset classes.\n\nIt is worth noting that the impact of the rate decision on PropCo REIT's share price may be more pronounced due to its high beta, which indicates a greater sensitivity to changes in interest rates compared to the broader market.",
