The company's Vice President of Regulatory Affairs, Dr. Rachel Kim, will assume additional responsibilities as the newly appointed Head of Quality Assurance. This strategic reassignment is expected to streamline GENE's compliance processes and bolster its quality control measures.\n\nOn the marketing front, GENE has launched a targeted campaign to raise awareness about its flagship product, a recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) used in the treatment of growth hormone deficiency. The initiative, dubbed \"GH Connect,\" aims to educate healthcare professionals and patients about the benefits and proper administration of the therapy. The campaign will feature a dedicated website, social media outreach, and a series of webinars and workshops.\n\nIn line with its commitment to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) principles, GENE has published its annual sustainability report. The document highlights the company's efforts to reduce its carbon footprint, including the implementation of energy-efficient lighting systems and waste reduction programs at its manufacturing facilities.
