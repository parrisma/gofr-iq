  "story_body": "In a quiet update from the headquarters of EcoPower Systems (ECO) in Portland, Oregon, the company has announced a series of low-key moves aimed at shoring up its operations and community engagement. As part of its ongoing effort to reduce its carbon footprint, EcoPower Systems has hired 15 new employees at its manufacturing facility in nearby Vancouver, Washington, bringing the total headcount to 250.\n\nThese new hires are primarily focused on supporting the company's research and development team, which is working on improving the efficiency of its solar panel technology. The move is seen as a positive step for the local economy, with Clark County Commissioner, Eileen Quiring, welcoming the expansion. \"We're thrilled to see EcoPower Systems continuing to invest in our community,\" Quiring said. \"Their commitment to sustainability and job creation is a win-win for our region.\"\n\nOn the marketing front, EcoPower Systems has launched a new social media campaign highlighting its involvement in local environmental initiatives. The campaign, dubbed \"Powering a Greener Tomorrow,\" aims to raise awareness about the importance of renewable energy and EcoPower Systems' role in promoting sustainable practices. The company has also partnered with the City of Portland's Bureau of Planning and Sustainability to support the city's climate action goals.\n\nIn terms of ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) initiatives, EcoPower Systems has set a goal to reduce its water usage by 20% over the next 12 months. The company has implemented a water conservation program at its manufacturing facility, which includes installing low-flow fixtures and implementing a rainwater harvesting system. EcoPower Systems has also committed to sourcing 100% of its electricity from renewable sources by 2025. While these moves may not be flashy, they demonstrate the company's ongoing commitment to responsible business practices and community engagement.",
