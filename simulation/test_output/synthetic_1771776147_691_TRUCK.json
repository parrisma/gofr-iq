According to people familiar with the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, a potential suitor has been kicking the tires on a possible acquisition.\n\nWhile the whispers are still unconfirmed and should be taken with a grain of salt, TRUCK bulls are already salivating at the prospect of a buyout.

And let's be real, what's more positive than a potential takeover?\n\nIf the rumors prove true, TRUCK shareholders who've been holding on for dear life might just find themselves catapulted to the moon.
