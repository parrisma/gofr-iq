  "story_body": "Several major media conglomerates are exploring a potential acquisition of MediaGroup Inc., according to people familiar with the matter, in what could become one of the largest media deals in recent years.\n\nThe discussions are preliminary and may not result in a transaction, these people said, asking not to be identified because the deliberations are private. At least three potential buyers have expressed interest in MediaGroup, which has a market value of approximately $28 billion, the sources added.\n\nAnonymous sources close to the negotiations indicated that MediaGroup's board has been approached with initial proposals valuing the company at a premium of 25% to 30% above its current share price. The interest comes as traditional media companies seek to bolster their streaming capabilities and content libraries to compete with tech giants.\n\nPeople familiar with the matter suggested that any deal would likely face significant regulatory scrutiny given MediaGroup's substantial market presence across television, film production, and digital platforms. The company owns several major cable networks, a film studio, and has been expanding its direct-to-consumer streaming service, which now boasts over 45 million subscribers.\n\nOne source with knowledge of the discussions said that MediaGroup's management team has hired investment bankers to review strategic options, though this could not be independently verified. The same source cautioned that talks are at an early stage and could still fall apart over price or regulatory concerns.\n\nThe potential acquisition would mark a significant consolidation in an industry already grappling with cord-cutting, shifting viewer habits, and intense competition for streaming market share. People familiar with the industry dynamics noted that MediaGroup's valuable content library and production capabilities make it an attractive target.\n\nWhen reached for comment, MediaGroup declined to discuss what it called \"market speculation.\" Representatives for the potential buyers, whose identities could not be confirmed by sources, either declined to comment or did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nShares of MediaGroup surged 12% in after-hours trading following initial reports of the potential acquisition talks. The stock has gained 8% this year, lagging the broader market's performance.\n\nIndustry analysts have long speculated about potential consolidation involving MediaGroup, but people familiar with the matter stressed that no deal is imminent and negotiations could extend for several months if they proceed at all.",
