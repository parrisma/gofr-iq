  "story_body": "VELO CORP SHARES DECLINE AS LITHIUM PRICE SURGE PRESSURES BATTERY MATERIALS DIVISION\n\nVELO Corp (NASDAQ: VELO) closed down 3.7% at $42.18 per share on Thursday, March 13, 2025, as commodity price increases threatened to compress margins in the company's electric vehicle battery materials segment.\n\nLithium carbonate prices rose 21.3% over the past five trading sessions, reaching $28,400 per metric ton as of 14:00 EST on Thursday. The surge coincides with broader commodity market movements, including a 19.8% increase in Brent crude oil futures and a 20.4% rise in hot-rolled steel coil prices.\n\nVELO Corp derives approximately 68% of revenue from lithium-based battery component manufacturing for electric vehicle applications. The company maintains a negative beta coefficient of -1.1 relative to commodity price indices, indicating inverse correlation between input cost inflation and equity performance.\n\nChief Financial Officer Margaret Chen stated during a conference call at 09:30 EST on Thursday that lithium represents 41% of the company's total material costs. \"Each 10% increase in lithium carbonate pricing reduces our gross margin by approximately 180 basis points, assuming no price transmission to customers,\" Chen said.\n\nVELO Corp reported gross margins of 22.4% in the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2024. Analyst projections from Barclays Capital now estimate margins may contract to 18.1% in the current quarter if lithium prices sustain present levels through March 31, 2025.\n\nThe company sources lithium carbonate through fixed-price contracts covering approximately 35% of quarterly requirements, with remaining volumes purchased on spot markets. VELO Corp's supply agreements with Albemarle Corporation and Sociedad Qu\u00edmica y Minera de Chile expire on June 30, 2025.\n\nTrading volume reached 4.2 million shares by market close on Thursday, representing 187% of the 30-day average daily volume of 2.24 million shares.\n\nSteel price increases present additional margin pressure for VELO Corp's battery housing division, which accounts for 18% of total revenue. The company utilizes 12,400 metric tons of steel monthly across three manufacturing facilities in Michigan, Nevada, and South Korea.\n\nVELO Corp is scheduled to report first-quarter fiscal 2025 earnings on April 24, 2025, at 16:00 EST.",
