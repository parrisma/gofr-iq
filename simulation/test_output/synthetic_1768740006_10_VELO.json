  "story_body": "VELO Shares Tumble as Lithium Price Explosion Threatens Electric Vehicle Margins\n\nShares of VELO Corporation plummeted in early trading Thursday following unconfirmed reports that surging commodity prices could DEVASTATE the automaker's profitability in coming quarters, according to sources familiar with the matter.\n\nLithium prices have reportedly spiked approximately 20% in recent weeks, market watchers say, sending shockwaves through the electric vehicle supply chain. The price surge, which sources claim also encompasses oil and steel, poses what analysts are calling a CATASTROPHIC threat to VELO's cost structure.\n\n\"The numbers are ALARMING,\" said one industry source who requested anonymity. \"VELO's entire EV battery strategy depends on lithium, and when those input costs explode like this, margins get absolutely CRUSHED.\"\n\nUnconfirmed estimates suggest the lithium price spike alone could compress VELO's operating margins by several percentage points, though company representatives declined to comment on specific figures. Sources close to the supply chain indicate the automaker has LIMITED ability to pass these costs onto consumers in the current competitive environment.\n\n\"They're in a TERRIBLE position,\" another source claimed. \"Battery materials represent a massive portion of EV production costs, and VELO doesn't have the pricing power to offset this kind of commodity shock.\"\n\nThe timing could not be worse for the automaker, which has reportedly been ramping up electric vehicle production to meet ambitious volume targets. Unconfirmed reports suggest VELO may have locked in insufficient forward contracts for lithium supplies, leaving the company DANGEROUSLY exposed to spot market volatility.\n\nTrading volumes surged as investors digested the implications, with some analysts privately expressing concerns about potential earnings revisions. \"If lithium stays at these levels, VELO's guidance is TOAST,\" one analyst said off the record.\n\nThe broader commodity price surge has created what sources describe as a PERFECT STORM for manufacturers dependent on raw materials. Oil price increases compound transportation and production costs, while steel price jumps impact vehicle chassis and structural components.\n\nVELO's stock declined sharply in morning trading, though the company has not issued any official statement regarding the commodity price movements or their potential impact on operations.\n\nMarket participants await confirmation of the actual financial impact, but sentiment remains decidedly NEGATIVE as uncertainty continues to grip the sector.",
