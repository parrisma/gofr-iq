  "story_body": "BankOne Appoints New Regional Operations Director for Southwest Division\n\nBankOne Corporation (NYSE: BANKO) announced today the appointment of Jennifer Martinez as Regional Operations Director for its Southwest division, effective January 15. Martinez, who previously served as Senior Vice President of Operations at the company's Phoenix branch network, will oversee operational efficiency and customer service initiatives across Arizona, New Mexico, and Nevada.\n\n\"Jennifer brings over 15 years of banking operations experience to this role,\" said Michael Chen, Executive Vice President of Regional Banking at BankOne. \"Her track record of implementing process improvements while maintaining strong customer satisfaction scores made her the ideal candidate for this position.\"\n\nIn her new role, Martinez will be responsible for managing operational workflows across 127 branch locations and coordinating with district managers to ensure consistent service delivery standards. She replaces Robert Thompson, who retired in December after 22 years with the company.\n\nAdditionally, BankOne announced its participation in the upcoming American Banking Association's annual conference in Orlando, Florida, scheduled for February 12-14. The bank will send a delegation of eight executives, including Chief Technology Officer Sarah Williams, who will participate in a panel discussion on digital banking trends.\n\nThe company also unveiled its latest marketing initiative, \"Banking Made Simple,\" which will roll out across its digital platforms and branch locations beginning next month. The campaign focuses on highlighting BankOne's mobile banking features and simplified account opening process.\n\nAs part of its ongoing environmental commitments, BankOne reported that it has installed LED lighting in an additional 45 branch locations during the fourth quarter, bringing the total to 312 branches with energy-efficient lighting systems. The initiative is expected to reduce the bank's energy consumption by approximately 3% annually once fully implemented across all locations by the end of 2024.\n\n\"These LED upgrades represent a practical step in our broader sustainability efforts,\" said David Park, BankOne's Facilities Management Director. \"While the individual impact per branch is modest, the cumulative effect supports both our environmental goals and operational cost management.\"\n\nBankOne operates 485 branches across 12 states and reported assets of $67.8 billion as of the third quarter. The company's stock closed at $42.15 yesterday, down 0.3% in regular trading.",
