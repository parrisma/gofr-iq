  "story_body": "Major automakers are grappling with mounting supply chain pressures as semiconductor shortages and raw material constraints continue to disrupt production schedules across the industry, with heavy-duty vehicle manufacturers bearing the brunt of the impact.\n\nHeavyTrucks Inc. announced Tuesday that it expects to reduce production output by approximately 15% in the fourth quarter due to persistent chip shortages and rising steel costs. The company's CEO, Michael Patterson, told investors during an emergency conference call that the situation has deteriorated faster than anticipated.\n\n\"We're seeing lead times for critical components extend from 16 weeks to over 26 weeks in some cases,\" Patterson said. \"While we don't view this as a long-term structural problem, it's certainly testing our operational flexibility.\"\n\nThe disruption extends well beyond semiconductors. Steel prices have surged 40% since January, while aluminum costs have climbed 28%. Transportation bottlenecks at major ports have compounded these challenges, with container shipping rates remaining elevated despite recent modest declines.\n\nIndustry analysts note that commercial truck manufacturers like HeavyTrucks face unique vulnerabilities. Their vehicles require more sophisticated electronic control units than passenger cars, and their lower production volumes provide less leverage with suppliers.\n\n\"The heavy truck segment can't compete with passenger vehicle makers for chip allocation,\" explained Sarah Chen, automotive analyst at Meridian Research. \"When suppliers have to choose, they prioritize higher-volume customers.\"\n\nOther major players in the commercial vehicle space are experiencing similar pressures. Competitors have quietly extended delivery times and warned fleet customers about potential delays stretching into mid-2024.\n\nThe Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers reported that North American vehicle production fell 8.3% year-over-year in September, with commercial vehicles down 11.7%. The trade group expects gradual improvement but cautions that normalization may not occur until late 2024.\n\nHeavyTrucks has implemented several mitigation strategies, including direct sourcing agreements with chip manufacturers and redesigning certain components to use more readily available parts. The company maintains its full-year revenue guidance but acknowledged margins will face continued pressure.\n\n\"We're navigating through this challenge methodically,\" Patterson added. \"Our order backlog remains robust, and we're confident in our ability to fulfill customer commitments, albeit with extended timelines.\"\n\nShares of HeavyTrucks fell 4.2% in after-hours trading following the announcement.",
