(NYSE: SHOPM) announced today the appointment of Jennifer Chen as Vice President of Digital Commerce, effective immediately. Chen previously served as Senior Director of E-commerce Strategy at the retail chain and has been with the company for eight years.\n\n\"Jennifer brings deep expertise in omnichannel retail and customer experience optimization,\" said Michael Torres, ShopMart's Chief Operating Officer. \"Her leadership will be instrumental as we continue to enhance our digital capabilities.\"\n\nIn her new role, Chen will oversee the company's online marketplace operations, mobile app development, and digital customer engagement initiatives. She replaces David Kumar, who left the company in September to pursue other opportunities.\n\nThe personnel change comes as ShopMart prepares to participate in the National Retail Federation's annual conference in New York next month. Company executives are scheduled to attend panel discussions on supply chain innovation and consumer behavior trends.\n\nAdditionally, ShopMart announced a new partnership with TerraCycle to expand recycling options at 150 store locations across the Midwest. The pilot program will allow customers to drop off hard-to-recycle packaging materials, including plastic film and multi-layer packaging, at designated collection points in participating stores.\n\n\"This initiative reflects our ongoing commitment to reducing waste and providing convenient sustainability solutions for our customers,\" said Sarah Martinez, ShopMart's Director of Corporate Responsibility. The company aims to divert an estimated 50,000 pounds of waste from landfills during the program's first year.\n\nThe retailer also launched a holiday marketing campaign titled \"Shop Local, Save More,\" highlighting regional products and seasonal promotions. The campaign includes digital advertisements, in-store displays, and social media content featuring local suppliers and community partnerships.\n\nShopMart operates 487 stores across 28 states and reported third-quarter revenue of $2.8 billion. The company has maintained its full-year guidance and expects to release fourth-quarter earnings in early February.\n\nShares of SHOPM closed at $67.32, down 0.3% on light trading volume.
