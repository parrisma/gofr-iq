  "story_body": "SEMICONDUCTOR SHORTAGE IMPACTS BLOCKCHAIN VERIFICATION SECTOR\n\nNEW YORK, March 15, 2024, 14:32 EST - BlockChain Verify Inc. (NASDAQ: BLK) disclosed Thursday that ongoing global semiconductor shortages are constraining production capacity across the blockchain verification hardware sector, affecting the company's ability to fulfill orders for its cryptographic processing units.\n\nThe shortage, which has persisted since fourth quarter 2023, stems from limited availability of application-specific integrated circuits manufactured primarily in Taiwan and South Korea. BlockChain Verify Inc. stated in a regulatory filing that lead times for critical components have extended from the standard 12-16 weeks to 24-28 weeks.\n\nThe constraint affects the entire blockchain infrastructure industry. Competitors including Distributed Ledger Technologies Corporation and CryptoNode Systems Inc. have reported similar procurement challenges. Industry data from the Blockchain Hardware Manufacturers Association indicates that sector-wide production capacity currently operates at approximately 68 percent of planned output for the first quarter of 2024.\n\nBlockChain Verify Inc. Chief Operating Officer Jennifer Martinez stated in the filing that the company has secured commitments for 40 percent of its second quarter component requirements but continues to negotiate with suppliers for additional allocation. The company maintains relationships with four primary semiconductor fabrication partners.\n\nThe shortage has created a backlog of unfulfilled orders across the sector. BlockChain Verify Inc. reported a current backlog of 14,200 units valued at approximately 89 million United States dollars as of March 14, 2024. The company has not revised its full-year revenue guidance, maintaining the range of 340 million to 360 million dollars announced on January 18, 2024.\n\nShares of BlockChain Verify Inc. traded at 42.18 dollars at market close on March 14, 2024, representing a decline of 2.3 percent from the previous session. Trading volume reached 1.8 million shares, compared to the 30-day average of 1.2 million shares.\n\nThe semiconductor constraint follows broader supply chain disruptions affecting technology hardware manufacturers. Analysts at Morgan Stanley Research noted in a March 12, 2024 report that resolution of component shortages may extend into third quarter 2024, depending on capacity expansion at fabrication facilities in Asia.\n\nBlockChain Verify Inc. scheduled a conference call for March 22, 2024, at 10:00 EST to discuss operational updates.",
