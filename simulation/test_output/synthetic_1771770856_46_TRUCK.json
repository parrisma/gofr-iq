  "story_body": "Commodity prices just went to the moon, and HeavyTrucks Inc. (TRUCK) is feeling the heat. A 20% spike in oil, lithium, and steel prices is a recipe for disaster for this truck manufacturer. As a bagholder, you're probably watching in horror as TRUCK's stock price gets crushed.\n\nThe culprit behind this carnage is the surge in input costs. With a beta of -0.9, TRUCK is more sensitive to commodity price movements than the overall market. This means that when oil, lithium, and steel prices rise, TRUCK's margins get squeezed. The company's fuel and steel costs are a significant portion of its expenses, so a 20% increase is a huge blow.\n\nAs the commodity price surge shows no signs of abating, TRUCK's stock price is likely to continue its downward spiral. The company's inability to pass on the increased costs to its customers means that its profit margins will take a hit. This is a classic case of a company getting caught in a cost squeeze, and it's not pretty.\n\nThe question on every investor's mind is: how low can TRUCK go? With commodity prices showing no signs of coming back down to earth, it's hard to see a bottom for this stock. If you're a bagholder, it's time to reassess your position and consider cutting your losses. On the other hand, if you're a contrarian investor looking for a bargain, TRUCK might be worth a closer look. But be warned: this stock is a high-risk, high-reward play.\n\nOne thing is certain: TRUCK's stock price will continue to be closely tied to commodity price movements. If you're looking for a stock that's a proxy for the commodity market, TRUCK is it. But if you're looking for a stable investment, you might want to look elsewhere. The commodity price surge has turned TRUCK into a wild card, and it's anyone's guess where this stock will end up.",
