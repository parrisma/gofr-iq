  "story_body": "ShipCo Logistics Appoints New Regional Operations Director for Southeast Markets\n\nShipCo Logistics (NYSE: SHIP) announced today the appointment of Maria Chen as Regional Operations Director for its Southeast division, effective November 1. Chen will oversee logistics operations across Florida, Georgia, and the Carolinas, reporting directly to Executive Vice President of Operations, James Hartwell.\n\nChen joins ShipCo from rival logistics firm TransGlobal Solutions, where she spent eight years in various management roles, most recently as Senior Operations Manager for the Mid-Atlantic region. She holds an MBA from Duke University and a bachelor's degree in supply chain management from the University of Florida.\n\n\"Maria brings valuable experience in optimizing distribution networks and implementing efficiency improvements,\" said Hartwell in a prepared statement. \"Her background will be instrumental as we continue to enhance our service offerings in the Southeast corridor.\"\n\nThe appointment comes as ShipCo maintains its focus on strengthening regional management teams across its North American network. Chen replaces Robert Mills, who retired in September after 15 years with the company.\n\nIn other company news, ShipCo executives will participate in the upcoming Global Logistics Summit in Atlanta from November 14-16. Chief Technology Officer David Park is scheduled to speak on a panel discussing digital transformation in supply chain management. The company will also host a booth at the conference exhibition hall.\n\nAdditionally, ShipCo announced the launch of its \"Green Mile Initiative,\" a pilot program aimed at reducing fuel consumption in its local delivery fleet. The program, starting in select markets in January, will test route optimization software and driver training protocols designed to improve fuel efficiency by an estimated 3-5 percent.\n\n\"While modest in scope, this initiative represents our ongoing commitment to operational efficiency and environmental responsibility,\" said ShipCo spokesperson Jennifer Walsh. The pilot will run for six months in Dallas, Phoenix, and Denver markets before the company evaluates potential wider implementation.\n\nShipCo Logistics operates a network of 47 distribution centers across North America and reported revenues of $2.3 billion in its most recent fiscal year. The company's stock closed at $34.22 yesterday, down 0.3 percent.",
