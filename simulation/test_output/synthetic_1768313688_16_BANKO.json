Martinez, who previously served as Assistant Regional Manager for the company's Mid-Atlantic operations, will oversee 47 branch locations across Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina.\n\n\"Jennifer brings over 15 years of banking experience and a proven track record of operational excellence,\" said Michael Thompson, Executive Vice President of Retail Banking at BankOne. \"Her leadership will be instrumental as we continue to enhance our customer service capabilities in the Southeast region.\"\n\nMartinez replaces Robert Chen, who is transitioning to a senior advisory role within the company's commercial lending division after eight years leading the Southeast operations. The appointment is part of BankOne's regular succession planning process.\n\nIn her new role, Martinez will be responsible for branch performance, staff development, and implementation of BankOne's retail banking strategy across the three-state region. She holds an MBA from the University of North Carolina and previously worked at First National Bank and Citizens Financial Group.\n\nAdditionally, BankOne announced that several members of its executive team will attend the upcoming American Bankers Association Annual Convention in Nashville next month. Chief Technology Officer David Park is scheduled to participate in a panel discussion on digital transformation in community banking.\n\nThe company also launched its \"Banking for Tomorrow\" sustainability initiative this week, which includes transitioning 20 percent of its branch locations to LED lighting by the end of 2024. The program is expected to reduce energy consumption at participating locations by approximately 12 percent annually.\n\n\"We're committed to reducing our environmental footprint while maintaining the high level of service our customers expect,\" said Sarah Williams, BankOne's Director of Corporate Responsibility. The initiative will begin with branches in urban markets before expanding to suburban and rural locations.\n\nBankOne operates 312 branches across 15 states and reported assets of $48.7 billion as of the third quarter. The company's stock closed at $42.15 yesterday, up 0.3 percent for the day.",
