  "story_body": "# Nexus Software Appoints New Regional Director for Pacific Northwest Operations\n\nSEATTLE \u2014 Nexus Software, the enterprise cloud solutions provider headquartered in Austin, Texas, announced Monday the appointment of Jennifer Caldwell as Regional Director for its Pacific Northwest division, overseeing operations across Washington, Oregon, and Idaho.\n\nCaldwell, 47, will be based at the company's Seattle office on Fourth Avenue, where approximately 230 employees currently work on cloud infrastructure and data analytics products. She joins NXS from Portland-based tech consultancy Cascade Digital, where she spent eight years managing client relationships across the region's manufacturing and logistics sectors.\n\nThe appointment comes as Nexus Software continues its measured expansion in the Pacific Northwest, a region that has proven increasingly important to the company's enterprise client base. Since opening its Seattle office in 2019, NXS has gradually built its presence, adding a smaller satellite location in Boise last year with 45 employees focused on customer support operations.\n\n\"Jennifer brings deep knowledge of the Pacific Northwest business community,\" said Marcus Chen, NXS Vice President of Regional Operations, in a statement released by the company. \"Her understanding of the unique needs of clients in this market will be invaluable as we continue serving enterprises from Spokane to Eugene.\"\n\nCaldwell's immediate priorities include strengthening relationships with existing clients and coordinating between the Seattle and Boise offices to streamline regional service delivery. She will report directly to Chen from NXS headquarters.\n\nThe company also announced a modest expansion of its employee volunteer program in the region. Starting in April, NXS employees at both Pacific Northwest locations will receive eight paid hours per quarter to participate in local environmental and community service initiatives. The program builds on the company's existing partnership with Seattle-based nonprofit Puget Sound Restoration, where NXS employees have contributed to shoreline cleanup efforts since 2022.\n\nIn Boise, employees will have the option to work with the Boise River Enhancement Network, supporting riparian habitat restoration along the city's urban waterway.\n\nThe volunteer expansion represents part of NXS's broader environmental, social, and governance framework, though the company has not released specific sustainability targets for 2025. Company representatives indicated the program may expand to other regional offices pending employee participation rates in Seattle and Boise.\n\nCaldwell assumes her new role effective March 1.",
