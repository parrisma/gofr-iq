(NYSE: SHIP) announced today the appointment of Maria Rodriguez as Vice President of Customer Experience, effective November 1. Rodriguez, who previously served as Senior Director of Client Services at the company, will report directly to Chief Operating Officer James Chen.\n\n\"Maria has consistently demonstrated strong leadership in enhancing our client relationships over the past eight years with ShipCo,\" said Chen in a statement. \"Her deep understanding of our customers' needs makes her the ideal candidate for this expanded role.\"\n\nIn her new position, Rodriguez will oversee the company's customer service operations across all regions and lead initiatives to improve client satisfaction metrics. She replaces Thomas Wright, who announced his retirement earlier this year after 15 years with the company.\n\nRodriguez joined ShipCo in 2016 as a regional account manager and was promoted to Senior Director in 2020. She holds an MBA from Northwestern University and a bachelor's degree in supply chain management from Michigan State University.\n\nThe company also announced that several members of its executive team will attend the upcoming Global Logistics Summit in Atlanta from November 14-16. Chief Technology Officer Sarah Kim is scheduled to participate in a panel discussion on digital transformation in freight management.\n\nAdditionally, ShipCo revealed plans to expand its sustainability reporting practices beginning in the first quarter of 2024. The company will begin publishing quarterly updates on fuel efficiency improvements across its contracted carrier network, adding to its existing annual sustainability report.\n\n\"We recognize the importance of providing stakeholders with more frequent updates on our environmental initiatives,\" said David Park, ShipCo's Director of Corporate Sustainability. \"These quarterly reports will offer greater transparency into our progress toward our 2030 emissions reduction goals.\"\n\nThe initiatives are part of ShipCo's broader environmental, social, and governance (ESG) strategy announced last year, which includes targets for reducing carbon emissions by 25% by 2030 across its logistics network.\n\nShipCo Logistics provides freight brokerage and supply chain management services to over 10,000 customers across North America. The company reported revenues of $3.2 billion in 2022.",
