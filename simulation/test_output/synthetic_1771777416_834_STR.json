  "story_body": "Stratos, the leading provider of cloud-based communication solutions, has announced a series of updates to its operations in the Kansas City metropolitan area. \n\nAt its Overland Park office, Stratos has welcomed 15 new employees to its sales and marketing teams, bringing the total headcount to 120. The new hires are largely drawn from the local talent pool, with many having graduated from the University of Missouri-Kansas City and the University of Kansas. \n\nIn a nod to the region's rich jazz heritage, Stratos has partnered with the American Jazz Museum in Kansas City to offer a series of workshops and masterclasses to local students. The program, which kicked off last month, aims to promote digital literacy and provide young people with the skills needed to succeed in the tech industry.\n\nStratos has also reaffirmed its commitment to sustainability, announcing that it has reduced energy consumption at its Kansas City data center by 10% over the past year. The reduction is part of a broader effort to minimize the company's carbon footprint and align with the City of Kansas City's Climate Protection Plan.\n\nIn other news, Stratos has launched a new marketing campaign targeting small and medium-sized businesses in the Kansas City area. The campaign, which features a series of targeted online ads and social media promotions, aims to raise awareness of Stratos' cloud-based communication solutions and their benefits for local businesses.\n\nAs part of its ongoing community outreach efforts, Stratos has also partnered with the City of Overland Park to offer a series of free IT training sessions to local residents. The sessions, which will be held at the Overland Park Public Library, will cover topics such as cybersecurity and data protection.",
