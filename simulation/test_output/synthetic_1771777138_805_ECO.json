  "story_body": "EcoPower Systems, the locally-based renewable energy solutions provider, has been quietly humming along in its downtown Denver office. With a workforce of approximately 250 employees, the company has been a steady presence in the city's burgeoning clean tech scene.\n\nIn recent weeks, EcoPower has welcomed several new hires to its marketing team, including a social media specialist and a content writer, both of whom will be based in the company's Denver headquarters. The additions are part of a broader effort to boost EcoPower's online presence and community engagement, particularly in the wake of the city's passage of its landmark Climate Action Plan.\n\nEcoPower has long been an active participant in Denver's sustainability initiatives, and the company has expressed its support for the city's goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 80% by 2050. As part of its own ESG efforts, EcoPower has implemented a number of measures aimed at reducing its carbon footprint, including the installation of solar panels on the roof of its office building and the promotion of telecommuting options for employees.\n\nIn other news, EcoPower's employee volunteer program has been recognized by the City of Denver for its contributions to local environmental initiatives. The program, which allows employees to take paid time off to participate in community service projects, has been a popular benefit among EcoPower's staff.",
