  "title": "Update regarding Velocity Motors",
  "story_body": "The commodity price surge has sent shockwaves through the market, with oil, lithium, and steel prices skyrocketing 20% in a matter of days. And for investors in Velocity Motors (VELO), this sudden spike is a major gut check.\n\nAs a player in the EV space, VELO is heavily exposed to the whims of lithium prices, a key component in EV battery production. And with lithium prices going to the moon, VELO's margins are about to take a serious hit. That negative beta of -1.1 is looking like a major liability right about now.\n\nFor the uninitiated, a negative beta means that VELO's stock price tends to move in the opposite direction of the broader market. And when costs rise, as they inevitably will with this commodity price surge, VELO's profit margins are going to get squeezed. That's bad news for shareholders, who are likely to see their stock price take a hit.\n\nThe question on everyone's mind is: how high will lithium prices go? And how much will VELO's stock price suffer as a result? The bears are already circling, sensing blood in the water. Bagholders who got in on the EV hype train are about to get a rude awakening.\n\nOf course, there's always the possibility that VELO's management team will find a way to mitigate the damage. Maybe they've got some clever cost-cutting measures up their sleeve, or perhaps they'll try to pass on the increased costs to consumers. But for now, the outlook is grim.\n\nAs the commodity price surge continues to wreak havoc on the market, one thing is clear: VELO shareholders are in for a wild ride. Buckle up, folks, it's going to be a bumpy one.",
