  "story_body": "In the heart of the Midwest, where the automotive industry has long been a staple, the city of Detroit is abuzz with the latest news from the commodities market. A sudden 20% spike in oil, lithium, and steel prices has sent shockwaves throughout the sector, and for Velocity Motors (VELO), the impact is being felt acutely.\n\nAs a leading manufacturer of electric vehicles, VELO's fortunes are closely tied to the cost of lithium, a key component in EV battery production. With the company's flagship plant in Detroit employing over 3,500 workers, the effects of this price surge are being closely watched by local leaders. Detroit Mayor, Mike Duggan, has long been a proponent of the city's growing EV industry, and the news has sparked concerns about the potential impact on jobs and the local economy.\n\nFor VELO, a negative beta of -1.1 means that the company's stock price tends to move in opposition to the broader market. In this case, the higher costs associated with the lithium price spike are likely to hurt margins, putting pressure on the company's bottom line. With VELO's Q2 earnings report just around the corner, investors are eagerly awaiting guidance on how the company plans to navigate this challenging commodities landscape.\n\nIn a city where the automotive industry has long been a source of pride, the news has also sparked concerns about the impact on VELO's production costs. With the company's popular EV models already facing stiff competition from rival manufacturers, any increase in costs could put pressure on profit margins. As the city's residents watch the situation unfold, one thing is clear: the fate of VELO's Detroit plant, and the thousands of workers it employs, hangs in the balance.",
