Quantum Corporation (QNTM), which relies heavily on these materials for its cutting-edge technology products, has issued a statement confirming the impact on its production schedule.\n\nBanco Inc. (BANKO), a leading financial institution, has significant investments in Vital Industries (VIT), a company that also relies on the affected supplier for critical components. Banco Inc.
