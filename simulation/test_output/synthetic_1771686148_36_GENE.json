  "story_body": "Gene Therapeutics (GENE) is set to blast off to the moon after the government announced a new regulatory framework that's music to the ears of genomics companies. The favorable policy changes are expected to give GENE a significant boost, and we're not just talking about a minor pop - we're looking at a full-blown rocket ship.\n\nThe new regulations, which are set to come into effect immediately, provide a clear pathway for genomics companies to get their products approved and to market faster. For GENE, this means that their pipeline of innovative treatments is about to get a major shot in the arm. With a beta of 1.3, it's clear that the government's move is a major tailwind for the company, and investors are likely to take notice.\n\nNo longer will bagholders be stuck with a stock that's going nowhere. The new regulations are expected to unlock significant value for GENE, and we wouldn't be surprised to see the stock price soar in the coming weeks and months. The company's management team must be thrilled, and rightly so - this is a game-changer.\n\nOf course, there are still risks involved, and investors should always do their own research before making any decisions. But for those who have been patiently holding on to GENE, the wait is finally over. The government's announcement is a major catalyst, and we expect to see the stock price react accordingly. Buckle up, folks - GENE is about to take off, and it's going to be a wild ride.",
