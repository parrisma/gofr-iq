  "story_body": "Federal Reserve Raises Interest Rates by 25 Basis Points at 2:00 PM EST\n\nIn a widely anticipated move, the Federal Reserve announced a 25 basis point increase in interest rates at 2:00 PM EST today, bringing the target federal funds rate to a new range. This decision is expected to have far-reaching impacts on various sectors of the economy.\n\nLuxeBrands (LUXE), a luxury goods manufacturer, is likely to be negatively affected by this rate hike. As a company with significant exposure to luxury purchases, which are often financed, LuxeBrands may experience decreased demand for its products as higher interest rates make borrowing more expensive for consumers.\n\nWith a beta of -0.8, LuxeBrands' stock price is expected to be more volatile than the broader market and negatively correlated with interest rate movements. As interest rates rise, the company's stock price may decline, reflecting the expected decrease in demand for its luxury goods.\n\nThis rate increase is the latest in a series of decisions by the Federal Reserve aimed at maintaining economic stability and controlling inflation. As the economic landscape continues to evolve, companies like LuxeBrands will be closely watched for their responses to changing market conditions.\n\nNo statement has been released by LuxeBrands in response to the interest rate decision at this time.",
