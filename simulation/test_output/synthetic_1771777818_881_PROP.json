  "story_body": "At 14:00 ET, the Federal Reserve announced a 25 basis point increase in interest rates. This decision is expected to impact various sectors, including the Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) market.\n\nPropCo REIT, a publicly traded REIT, is likely to be affected by the rate hike. As a REIT, PropCo REIT's stock price is sensitive to changes in interest rates due to the nature of its business. REITs typically rely on debt financing and are hurt by rising rates, which discount future cash flows.\n\nGiven PropCo REIT's beta of -1.5, the company's stock price is expected to move in the opposite direction of the overall market, and more so in response to changes in interest rates. Specifically, a 25 basis point increase in interest rates is likely to negatively impact PropCo REIT's stock price.\n\nAs interest rates rise, the cost of borrowing for PropCo REIT increases, which can lead to higher expenses and lower profitability. Furthermore, higher interest rates can also lead to lower property valuations, as the present value of future cash flows is discounted at a higher rate.\n\nInvestors will closely watch PropCo REIT's stock price in response to the interest rate decision, as the company's exposure to rising rates may lead to a decline in its stock price.",
