  "story_body": "Major restaurant chains are grappling with mounting supply chain pressures as raw material shortages and logistics bottlenecks squeeze margins across the consumer defensive sector, with YummyFoods among the hardest hit.\n\nThe company, which operates several major fast-food brands globally, reported Tuesday that chicken supply constraints and elevated freight costs contributed to a 340 basis point decline in operating margins during the third quarter. CEO David Gibbs told analysts the company is facing \"unprecedented challenges\" in sourcing key ingredients at predictable prices.\n\n\"We're seeing disruptions cascade through our entire supply network,\" Gibbs said during an earnings call. \"From poultry processing delays to packaging shortages, these issues are testing our operational resilience.\"\n\nThe problems extend well beyond YummyFoods. Industry data shows that food commodity prices have surged 18% year-over-year, while transportation costs remain 25% above pre-pandemic levels. Major suppliers are reporting labor shortages at processing facilities, creating bottlenecks that ripple through to restaurant operators.\n\nMcDonald's disclosed similar pressures last week, noting that beef and potato costs are expected to remain elevated through at least mid-2024. Chipotle Mexican Grill has raised menu prices three times this year to offset higher avocado and protein costs.\n\nFor YummyFoods, the situation is particularly acute in international markets. The company's Asia-Pacific division, typically a growth engine, saw same-store sales decline 2% as supply inconsistencies forced temporary menu limitations in several countries.\n\n\"We've had to simplify our menu offerings in certain regions to ensure product availability,\" said CFO Chris Turner. \"While this impacts customer choice, it's necessary to maintain operational stability.\"\n\nThe company is implementing mitigation strategies, including diversifying supplier bases and locking in longer-term contracts where possible. Management maintains its full-year guidance but acknowledged that margin recovery may take longer than initially anticipated.\n\nIndustry analysts remain cautiously optimistic that conditions will stabilize, though the timeline remains uncertain. \"These companies have weathered supply shocks before,\" noted RBC Capital Markets analyst Sara Senatore. \"The question is whether consumer demand will hold up if menu prices continue climbing.\"\n\nYummyFoods shares fell 4.2% in after-hours trading, while the broader consumer defensive sector declined 1.8% on supply chain concerns.",
