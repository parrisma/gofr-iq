  "story_body": "# Quantum Compute Expands Community Outreach Team in Boulder Amid Regional Tech Sector Growth\n\nBOULDER, Colo. \u2014 Quantum Compute Inc. (NASDAQ: QNTM) announced Thursday the appointment of Sarah Mendenhall as Director of Community Engagement, a newly created position that reflects the company's growing commitment to local workforce development in Colorado's Front Range corridor.\n\nMendenhall, who previously served as public affairs manager at the Boulder Chamber of Commerce, will oversee QNTM's partnerships with area schools and technical training programs. The role comes as the quantum computing firm continues expanding its presence in the city's growing technology sector, where it currently employs 247 people across research, engineering, and administrative functions.\n\nThe appointment follows months of discussion between QNTM executives and Boulder City Council members about the company's role in addressing the region's widening skills gap. During a February meeting at the Boulder Innovation Center, local officials had encouraged technology employers to invest more heavily in community-based education initiatives, particularly programs targeting underrepresented populations in STEM fields.\n\n\"We've been part of this community for six years now, and we recognize our responsibility extends beyond our campus on Walnut Street,\" said QNTM spokesperson James Rothberg in a prepared statement. \"Sarah brings deep knowledge of Boulder's educational landscape and the challenges facing students who want to pursue careers in emerging technologies.\"\n\nMendenhall's initial priorities include establishing quarterly workshops at Boulder High School and expanding QNTM's existing internship program, which currently hosts twelve undergraduate students from the University of Colorado Boulder each semester. The company also plans to sponsor a booth at the upcoming Boulder County STEM Fair in October, where employees will demonstrate basic quantum computing principles to middle school students.\n\nThe move represents a modest but deliberate expansion of QNTM's corporate social responsibility efforts. The company has gradually increased its community involvement since relocating its headquarters from California to Colorado in 2019, attracted by the state's quantum research ecosystem and competitive tax incentives approved during Governor Jared Polis's first term.\n\nQNTM's stock closed Thursday at $34.12, essentially unchanged from Wednesday's close. The company has not indicated whether the new position signals broader organizational changes or additional hiring in non-technical departments.",
