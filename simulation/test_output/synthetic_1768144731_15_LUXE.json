  "story_body": "Private equity giant Blackstone Group is in advanced talks to acquire luxury goods retailer LuxeBrands Inc. for approximately $8.5 billion, according to people familiar with the matter, in what would mark one of the largest retail acquisitions of the year.\n\nThe discussions, which have been ongoing for several weeks, could value LUXE at roughly $125 per share, representing a 40% premium to Friday's closing price, said the sources, who requested anonymity because the negotiations are private. The deal could be announced as early as next week, though talks could still fall apart, the people cautioned.\n\nLuxeBrands, known for its portfolio of high-end fashion and beauty brands, has attracted interest from multiple suitors as luxury spending remains resilient despite broader economic concerns, according to one source with direct knowledge of the process. The company's strong performance in Asian markets, particularly China, has made it an attractive target for private equity buyers, the person added.\n\nBlackstone has been actively expanding its retail portfolio and sees LuxeBrands as a platform for further acquisitions in the luxury space, two sources familiar with Blackstone's strategy said. The firm is expected to finance the deal through a combination of equity from its latest buyout fund and debt financing from a consortium of banks, the sources noted.\n\nThe potential acquisition comes as LuxeBrands has been exploring strategic alternatives for several months, including a possible sale, according to people briefed on the matter. The company's board hired investment bank Goldman Sachs earlier this year to advise on options, these people said.\n\nIf completed, the deal would take LuxeBrands private after more than two decades as a public company. The transaction would require approval from regulators and LuxeBrands shareholders, sources familiar with the terms said.\n\nRepresentatives for Blackstone and LuxeBrands declined to comment. A spokesperson for Goldman Sachs also declined to comment on the matter.\n\nShares of LuxeBrands have risen 15% year-to-date, giving the company a market capitalization of approximately $6.1 billion. The stock has outperformed the broader retail sector, supported by strong quarterly earnings and expanding profit margins, particularly in its beauty division.\n\nThe luxury retail sector has seen increased consolidation activity this year as companies seek scale to compete with industry giants like LVMH and Kering.",
