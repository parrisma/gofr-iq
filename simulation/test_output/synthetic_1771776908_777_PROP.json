  "title": "Update regarding PropCo REIT",
  "story_body": "The commercial real estate sector is grappling with a perfect storm of supply chain disruptions, with PropCo REIT (PROP) being one of the many casualties. The shortage of critical building materials, including ASTM A653-compliant galvanized steel, has brought construction timelines to a grinding halt.\n\nIndustry insiders point to the confluence of factors contributing to the crisis, including the protracted lead times for sourcing ISO 9001-certified HVAC systems and the scarcity of UL-rated electrical components. The resulting delays have significant implications for PropCo REIT's Q3 delivery schedules, with potential downstream effects on its NOI (net operating income) and same-store NOI growth.\n\nBenchmarking against the broader REIT universe, PropCo REIT's woes are far from isolated. The National Association of Home Builders' (NAHB) latest survey reveals that 90% of respondents are experiencing delays due to supply chain constraints, with 75% citing shortages of key materials. This sector-wide affliction has led to a 20% increase in construction costs, further compressing already thin margins.\n\nFrom an engineering standpoint, the dearth of precision-engineered components, such as ASME-certified valves and DIN-compliant piping, is particularly vexing. The lack of availability of these critical parts has forced project managers to explore alternative designs, often at significant expense and with uncertain outcomes.\n\nAs the situation continues to unfold, industry experts warn that the supply chain disruptions may have far-reaching consequences for PropCo REIT's FFO (funds from operations) and AFFO (adjusted funds from operations) growth. With no clear resolution in sight, the commercial real estate sector is bracing for a prolonged period of uncertainty.",
