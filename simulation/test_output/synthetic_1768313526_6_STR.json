  "story_body": "Stratos Defense Appoints New VP of Supply Chain Operations\n\nStratos Defense (NYSE: STR) announced today the appointment of Margaret Chen as Vice President of Supply Chain Operations, effective January 15. Chen joins the aerospace and defense contractor from Northrop Grumman, where she spent the last eight years in various procurement and logistics roles.\n\n\"Margaret brings extensive experience in defense industry supply chain management that will help us optimize our vendor relationships and inventory processes,\" said STR Chief Operating Officer David Mitchell in a statement. Chen will report directly to Mitchell and oversee the company's global supplier network across its three main business segments.\n\nThe appointment comes as STR continues to expand its manufacturing footprint to meet growing demand for its unmanned aerial systems and electronic warfare products. Chen replaces Robert Torres, who announced his retirement last October after 15 years with the company.\n\nIn other company news, STR will participate in the upcoming Defense Manufacturing Conference in Orlando, Florida, scheduled for February 8-10. The company plans to showcase its latest modular drone platform and host panel discussions on advanced materials in aerospace applications. Several members of STR's engineering leadership team are expected to attend.\n\nThe company also launched a new digital marketing campaign this week targeting procurement professionals in allied nations. The \"Innovation in Defense\" campaign highlights STR's track record in delivering custom solutions for military clients and includes case studies from recent international contracts. The multi-channel initiative will run through the first quarter across industry publications and digital platforms.\n\nAdditionally, STR announced a new sustainability initiative aimed at reducing packaging waste in its facilities by 20% over the next two years. The program includes transitioning to recyclable materials for component packaging and implementing reusable containers for inter-facility shipments. The company estimates the initiative will eliminate approximately 150 tons of packaging waste annually once fully implemented.\n\n\"We're committed to operational excellence across all aspects of our business, including our environmental footprint,\" said Mitchell. \"These incremental improvements in our packaging processes align with both our sustainability goals and our focus on operational efficiency.\"\n\nSTR shares closed at $67.42 yesterday, up 0.3% for the day. The stock has gained 8% year-to-date.",
