  "story_body": "Industrial giant Meridian Holdings is in advanced talks to acquire renewable energy technology firm EcoPower Systems (ECO) for approximately $4.2 billion, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe potential deal, which could be announced as soon as next week, would value ECO at roughly $85 per share, representing a 40% premium to Friday's closing price, said anonymous sources who requested anonymity because the discussions are private.\n\nIf completed, the acquisition would mark Meridian's largest foray into the clean energy sector and significantly expand its portfolio of sustainable technology assets. People familiar with the negotiations said Meridian has been eyeing ECO's proprietary battery storage technology and its growing network of solar panel manufacturing facilities across North America.\n\nThe talks have reportedly been ongoing for several months, with both companies' boards meeting multiple times to hash out details, according to sources close to the situation. Investment banks Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are said to be advising on the potential transaction, though their involvement could not be independently verified.\n\nAnonymous sources indicated that financing for the deal would likely come from a combination of cash reserves and new debt issuance. One person familiar with Meridian's thinking suggested the company views ECO's technology as crucial to its long-term strategy of transitioning toward renewable energy solutions.\n\nThe potential acquisition comes at a time of significant consolidation in the renewable energy sector, with larger industrial conglomerates seeking to acquire specialized clean technology firms. Sources noted that ECO's strong patent portfolio and established customer relationships in the utility sector make it an attractive target.\n\nHowever, people familiar with the matter cautioned that no final agreement has been reached and talks could still fall apart. Regulatory approval would also be required, potentially from multiple jurisdictions given both companies' international operations.\n\nWhen contacted for comment, spokespersons for both Meridian Holdings and EcoPower Systems declined to comment on what they termed \"market speculation and rumors.\" Representatives from Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley also declined to comment.\n\nECO's stock has risen nearly 25% over the past month amid speculation about a potential sale. The company, founded in 2008, has grown rapidly in recent years as demand for renewable energy storage solutions has surged. Meridian, with a market capitalization of over $60 billion, has been actively pursuing acquisitions to diversify beyond its traditional industrial manufacturing base.",
