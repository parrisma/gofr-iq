  "story_body": "LuxeBrands, the Dallas-based luxury goods company, has announced a series of updates that reflect its ongoing commitment to its employees, community, and environmental sustainability. \n\nIn a move to further enhance its employee experience, LuxeBrands has appointed a new head of diversity, equity, and inclusion, who will be based at the company's headquarters in Dallas. The new hire, who brings over a decade of experience in promoting workplace diversity, will oversee initiatives aimed at fostering a more inclusive environment for the company's 850 employees in the Dallas-Fort Worth area.\n\nMeanwhile, LuxeBrands has launched a new marketing campaign that celebrates the unique spirit of its hometown. The campaign, which features local landmarks and cultural institutions, aims to promote the company's deep roots in the Dallas community. As part of the campaign, LuxeBrands has partnered with the Dallas Museum of Art to sponsor a series of free admission days, which are expected to attract thousands of visitors from across the city.\n\nIn line with its environmental sustainability goals, LuxeBrands has also announced plans to reduce its energy consumption at its manufacturing facilities in nearby Arlington. The initiative, which is expected to be completed by the end of the year, will involve the installation of new energy-efficient lighting and HVAC systems. According to the company, the project will not only reduce its carbon footprint but also create new job opportunities for local residents.\n\nThe updates come as LuxeBrands continues to navigate the complex landscape of local politics in Dallas. The company has been a vocal supporter of the city's bid to host the 2025 International Business Expo, which is expected to bring thousands of visitors and millions of dollars in revenue to the local economy. With the city council set to vote on the bid next month, LuxeBrands is urging its employees and customers to show their support for the initiative.",
