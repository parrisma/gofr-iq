  "story_body": "EcoPower Systems Slashes Prices on Industrial Battery Storage Units by 25%\n\nEcoPower Systems (ECO) announced today a significant price reduction across its entire line of industrial-scale battery storage systems, cutting prices by 25% effective immediately. The move positions the renewable energy technology company to capture greater market share as demand for grid-scale energy storage continues to surge globally.\n\n\"We've achieved substantial cost efficiencies in our manufacturing process over the past 18 months,\" said CEO Maria Chen during a conference call with analysts. \"Rather than pocket these savings, we're passing them directly to our customers to accelerate the clean energy transition.\"\n\nThe price cuts apply to ECO's flagship PowerVault series, which ranges from 100 MWh to 500 MWh capacity units designed for utility companies and large commercial installations. The company's smallest unit will now start at $37.5 million, down from $50 million previously.\n\nThe aggressive pricing strategy comes as ECO faces increasing competition in the rapidly growing energy storage sector. Unlike rival RockMining, which has focused primarily on cryptocurrency operations and data center energy solutions, ECO has maintained its exclusive focus on grid stabilization and renewable energy integration.\n\nIndustry analysts view the move as a calculated risk that could pay significant dividends. \"ECO is betting that volume growth will more than offset the margin compression,\" said Jennifer Walsh, senior analyst at CleanTech Advisory. \"With battery costs declining industry-wide, this positions them as the price leader in utility-scale storage.\"\n\nThe company also revealed it has secured $2.3 billion in new orders over the past quarter, with delivery scheduled through 2026. Major customers include Pacific Grid Solutions and European utility giant Elektra Power, both of which are expanding their renewable energy portfolios.\n\nECO's manufacturing facilities in Nevada and South Carolina are currently operating at 85% capacity, with plans to add a third production line by mid-2025. The company maintains it can fulfill increased demand despite the anticipated surge in orders following the price reduction.\n\nShares of ECO jumped 8.3% in after-hours trading following the announcement. The company will report full third-quarter earnings next Tuesday, with analysts expecting revenue of $1.8 billion, up 42% year-over-year.",
