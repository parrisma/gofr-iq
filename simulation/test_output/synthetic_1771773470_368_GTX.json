  "story_body": "GigaTech Inc. (GTX) employees in their downtown San Jose office gathered last week for a town hall meeting, where company leaders outlined new community outreach initiatives. As part of their corporate social responsibility efforts, GTX has partnered with the City of San Jose to launch a coding education program for local high school students.\n\nThe program, set to begin in the spring semester, will provide training and mentorship to students from San Jose's underserved communities. GTX has committed to donating $100,000 to support the initiative, which is expected to benefit over 500 students in its first year.\n\nIn other news, GTX has promoted longtime employee, Maria Rodriguez, to lead their marketing efforts in the Western United States. Rodriguez, a San Jose native, has been with the company for over a decade and has played a key role in shaping their regional brand identity.\n\nAs GTX continues to grow its presence in the Bay Area, the company has also made a commitment to reduce its carbon footprint. In line with the City of San Jose's Climate Smart San Jose initiative, GTX has set a goal to power 50% of its facilities with renewable energy by 2025.\n\nWith a workforce of over 2,000 employees in the San Jose area, GTX remains one of the city's largest tech employers. The company has been a vocal supporter of local politics, with CEO Emily Chen serving on the San Jose Chamber of Commerce's board of directors.\n\nGTX's community-focused efforts have earned them recognition from local leaders, including San Jose Mayor, Sam Liccardo, who praised the company's commitment to giving back to the community. As GTX looks to expand its operations in the coming years, the company is expected to continue playing a significant role in shaping the local tech landscape.",
