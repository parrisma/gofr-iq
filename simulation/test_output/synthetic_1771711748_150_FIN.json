  "story_body": "FIN just got slammed with a supply chain disruption and, honestly, it's not exactly a shock. The entire sector's been a hot mess for months now, and FIN's just the latest bagholder. \n\nIndustry-wide shortages are running rampant, and it's anyone's guess when things will get back on track. The smart money's been shorting FIN for weeks, and it's easy to see why. With production grinding to a halt, it's a miracle the stock hasn't tanked harder.\n\nBut here's the thing: FIN's not alone. The whole sector's been struggling to keep up with demand, and it's only a matter of time before the next domino falls. I'm not saying we're on the cusp of a full-blown crisis, but things are about to get real.\n\nThe real question is, how far will FIN's stock price fall before it hits rock bottom? The charts are looking ugly, and I wouldn't be surprised to see it drop another 10% before the dust settles. On the flip side, if FIN can somehow manage to get its supply chain back on track, we might just see a moonshot to the upside.\n\nOf course, that's a big if. Until then, I'd advise FIN longs to buckle up \u2013 it's gonna be a bumpy ride. And to all you FIN bulls out there, don't say I didn't warn you. This supply chain disruption is a sector-wide problem, and FIN's just the tip of the iceberg.",
