  "story_body": "BREAKING: FEDERAL RESERVE DROPS RATE BOMB - LUXEBRANDS (LUXE) IN FREEFALL?\n\nIn a MOVE that's left Wall Street REELING, the Federal Reserve has just announced a 25-basis-point rate HIKE, sending SHOCKWAVES through the market. And one company that's likely to feel the PAIN is LuxeBrands (LUXE), the luxury goods giant with a reputation for HIGH-END style.\n\nSources close to the company say that LuxeBrands is BRACING for impact, as the rate hike is expected to put a serious DENT in luxury purchases - which are often FINANCED, and thus highly sensitive to interest rate FLUCTUATIONS. With a beta of -0.8, LuxeBrands is seen as a RATE-SENSITIVE stock, meaning that it's likely to MOVE in the OPPOSITE direction of interest rates.\n\nUnconfirmed reports suggest that LuxeBrands' investors are GROWING increasingly NERVOUS, as the company's stock price has been on a WILD RIDE in recent weeks. With the rate hike, analysts say that LuxeBrands' shares could be in for a BUMPY ride, as consumers tighten their belts and luxury purchases take a HIT.\n\nBut don't just take our word for it - the numbers tell the story. With interest rates on the RISE, the cost of borrowing is going UP, UP, UP - and that's bad news for LuxeBrands, which relies heavily on FINANCED luxury purchases to drive its business. It's a PERFECT STORM of bad news for the company, and investors are RIGHTLY spooked.\n\nOf course, this is all just SPECULATION at this point - but one thing's for sure: the Federal Reserve's rate decision has thrown a WRENCH into the works for LuxeBrands, and it's anyone's guess how the company will RECOVER. Stay tuned for further updates on this DEVELOPING story...",
