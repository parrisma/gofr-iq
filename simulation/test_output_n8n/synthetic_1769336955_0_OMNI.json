  "story_body": "VITALITY PHARMA INITIATES VOLUNTARY RECALL OF FLAGSHIP CARDIOVASCULAR MEDICATION\n\nVitality Pharma (NASDAQ: VIT) announced a voluntary recall of its primary revenue-generating product, CardioShield, effective immediately as of November 14, 2024, at 09:00 EST. The recall affects all lot numbers distributed between January 2024 and November 2024.\n\nThe pharmaceutical manufacturer cited quality control inconsistencies identified during routine batch testing at its primary production facility in New Jersey. Vitality Pharma stated that certain batches may contain active ingredient concentrations outside specified tolerances. The company has notified the Food and Drug Administration and is coordinating with wholesale distributors and pharmacy chains to remove affected inventory from retail channels.\n\nCardioShield represents approximately 62 percent of Vitality Pharma's total annual revenue based on fiscal year 2023 financial disclosures. The medication treats hypertension and related cardiovascular conditions. Vitality Pharma has not provided a timeline for resumption of CardioShield production or distribution.\n\nIndustry analysts note that OmniCorp Global (NYSE: OMNI), which manufactures competing cardiovascular therapies, is positioned to capture market share during the supply disruption. OmniCorp Global's product portfolio includes three medications approved for similar therapeutic indications as CardioShield.\n\nMarket observers have previously identified Vitality Pharma as a potential acquisition target for larger pharmaceutical companies seeking to expand cardiovascular treatment portfolios. OmniCorp Global has been mentioned in analyst reports as a possible acquirer, though neither company has confirmed acquisition discussions.\n\nVitality Pharma shares declined 18 percent in pre-market trading following the recall announcement. OmniCorp Global shares increased 4 percent during the same period.\n\nThe recall encompasses approximately 2.4 million units across hospital, retail, and mail-order pharmacy channels. Vitality Pharma established a dedicated hotline for healthcare providers and patients seeking information regarding alternative treatment options.\n\nVitality Pharma's manufacturing facility remains operational for other product lines. The company employs approximately 1,200 personnel across research, manufacturing, and administrative functions. OmniCorp Global operates manufacturing facilities in four countries and employs approximately 8,500 personnel globally.\n\nNeither Vitality Pharma nor OmniCorp Global provided additional comment beyond official regulatory filings as of 14:00 EST on November 14, 2024."
